# Topic 7 Review (Topic 7 Part 4)

## Summary
This final part of Topic 7 reviews our place in the Universe, from the Earth and Sun to the Milky Way and the Local Group. It highlights the "Pale Blue Dot" perspective (Voyager 1) and current limitations in understanding (Dark Matter). It also emphasizes the future of detecting life on exoplanets.
