    "## 3.1  Root mean square deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "One quantity that can be used to decide how good a fit is (and therefore which function best fits a set of data) is the **root mean square deviation**. This is true not just for linear fits but for any type of fit. For example, if the data you are fitting does not follow a linear relationship, you may test several different functions and use the root mean square deviation to decide which one provides the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a function whose values  depend on a variable $x$, in other words $y(x)$ is a function of $x$. If we use $(x_i, y_i)$ to indicate that we have a pair of measured $(x,y)$ values, and we are able to calculate the values of the function (we’ll call these $y_i^{calc}$ ) for each $x_i$, then the deviation of the measured point $y_i$ with respect to the calculated point $y_i^{calc}$  is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_i - y_i^{calc}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we then take the square of this quantity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(y_i - y_i^{calc})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the mean square deviation is the sum of the squares of the deviations for all  points divided by $N$, the number of points:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\sum_i^N (y_i - y_i^{calc})^2}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the root mean square deviation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_i^N (y_i - y_i^{calc})^2}{N}}$$                        (Eqn 4.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase ‘root mean square deviation’ is therefore a shorthand for saying ‘the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviations’. The smaller the root mean square deviation, the better the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, normally, we would use a function of $x$ to obtain the different values of $y_i^{calc}$. If different functions can possibly be used to determine the values of $y_i^{calc}$, then calculating the root mean square deviation will tell us which function gives the best fit – it will be the one with the smallest value of the root mean square deviation. Similarly, if different sets of data, for example from different experiments, are available, the root mean square deviation will tell us which is the best fit. In other words, which measured results are closer to a straight line."
