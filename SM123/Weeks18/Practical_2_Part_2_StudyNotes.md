# Practical 2 Part 2: Background Radiation

## Summary

Background radiation is all around us but cannot be detected without specialized instruments. This investigation uses a cloud chamber to measure background radiation and identify radiation types from unknown samples.

## Key Concepts

### What is Radiation?

**Definition**: The release or transmission of energy associated with particles or waves through space or a material.

**Types include:**
- Alpha particles (helium nuclei)
- Beta particles (electrons)
- Electromagnetic waves (radio, X-rays, visible light, gamma rays)

### Classifying Radiation

**Non-ionising radiation** (low energy):
- Radio waves, visible light, microwaves
- Generally safe for daily exposure
- Example: microwave ovens

**Ionising radiation** (high energy):
- Enough energy to knock electrons free from atoms
- Can damage living tissue
- Examples: alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, X-rays, UV

### Health Effects of Ionising Radiation

**High dose exposure (brief):**
- Radiation burns
- Radiation sickness/poisoning

**Low dose exposure (prolonged):**
- Cumulative DNA damage
- DNA mutations
- Cancer risk

### Sources of Background Radiation

**Natural sources:**
- **Cosmic rays**: From space; intensity increases with altitude
- **NORM** (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material): In Earth's crust
- **Radon gas**: Released from decaying material in soil
- Food and water (absorbed from environment)

**Man-made sources:**
- Medical X-rays and radiotherapy
- Nuclear weapons testing (legacy)
- Nuclear power waste

**Higher exposure groups:**
- Miners (underground NORM exposure)
- Airline pilots (high altitude cosmic rays)
- Astronauts (1 day in orbit ≈ 1 year at sea level)

### The Cloud Chamber

An instrument for detecting and visualizing ionising radiation:
- Tracks become visible when radiation ionizes air
- Different radiation types produce characteristic tracks

## Cloud Chamber Track Identification

| Radiation Type | Track Characteristics |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Alpha particles | Short, thick, bright, straight |
| Beta particles | Long, thin, curved/curled |
| Background | Faint, sporadic |

## Investigation Tasks

### Task 1: Preparation
- Prepare spreadsheet for recording observations
- Include: track counts, rectangle numbers, time periods
- Calculate: average tracks, tracks per minute, tracks per second

### Task 2: Data Collection
- Watch cloud chamber video (no source loaded)
- Count tracks in 3 rectangles over 2 minutes each
- Calculate mean tracks per minute and per second
- This estimates background radiation level

### Task 3: Radiation Classification
- Use the "Spotters Guide" to identify track types
- Watch videos of samples 1, 2, and 3
- Describe tracks: number, shape, width, brightness, length
- Classify each sample as:
  - Alpha particle emitter
  - Beta particle emitter
  - Not radioactive
