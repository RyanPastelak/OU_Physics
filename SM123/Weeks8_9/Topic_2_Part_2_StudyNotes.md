# Topic 2 Part 2: Kinetic and Potential Energy

## Summary

All energy "forms" are composed of **kinetic energy** (energy of motion) and **potential energy** (energy of arrangement/position). Chemical energy comes from atomic arrangements; thermal energy comes from microscopic particle motion.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| E_k = ½mv² | Kinetic Energy | Energy of motion |
| E_g = mgh | Gravitational PE (Earth) | Near Earth's surface |
| v = gt | Falling Speed | Speed after time t |
| E_g,planet = -GMm/r | Gravitational PE (orbit) | For orbiting bodies |
| E_el = VQ | Electrical PE | Charge Q at potential V |

**Constants**:
- g = 9.81 m s⁻² (Earth's surface gravity)
- G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² (gravitational constant)
- M_Sun = 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg

## Key Concepts

### Kinetic Energy
- **Proportional to mass**: E_k ∝ m (double mass = double energy)
- **Proportional to speed squared**: E_k ∝ v² (double speed = 4× energy!)
- A ball thrown at 100 kph has 2× the kinetic energy of one at 71 kph
- This is why fast cars are much more dangerous in collisions

### Gravitational Potential Energy
- Depends on mass, height, and gravitational acceleration
- At bottom of hill, E_g = 0 (reference point)
- As height increases, E_g increases

### Conservation of Energy
- Total energy E_k + E_g is constant (ignoring friction)
- As skier descends: E_g decreases, E_k increases
- The increase in kinetic energy equals decrease in potential energy

### Planetary Orbits
- **Perihelion**: Closest point to Sun (planet moves fastest)
- **Aphelion**: Furthest point from Sun (planet moves slowest)
- E_g is always negative for orbiting planets (maximum = 0 at r = ∞)
- Total energy E_k + E_g is constant throughout orbit

### Electrical Potential Energy
- Like charges repel; opposite charges attract
- Potential difference (V) in volts
- E_el = VQ where Q is charge in coulombs
- Electron charge: Q_e = -1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
- Proton charge: Q_p = +1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
- Cell membranes have ~-70 mV potential difference

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 2.1: Kinetic Energy Graph

Which of the three plots correctly represents kinetic energy of a bowling ball vs speed?

**Solution:** The correct plot is the **curved (parabolic) graph** that curves upward.

Since E_k = ½mv², kinetic energy is proportional to v². This means:
- At v = 0, E_k = 0
- The graph curves upward (not a straight line)
- The curve gets steeper as v increases

A straight line would represent E_k ∝ v (incorrect).

### Exercise 2.1: Pedestrian Safety

Research shows 25% chance of serious injury at 23 mph, rising to 50% at 31 mph.

**Question 1:** By what factor does the chance of serious injury increase?

**Solution:** Factor = 50% / 25% = **2** (injury risk doubles)

---

**Question 2:** By what factor has the car speed increased from 23 mph to 31 mph?

**Solution:** Factor = 31 / 23 = **1.35** (speed increases by 35%)

---

**Question 3:** By what factor has the kinetic energy increased?

**Solution:** Since E_k ∝ v²:
Factor = (31/23)² = 1.35² = **1.82** ≈ **1.8** (kinetic energy nearly doubles)

---

**Question 4:** Summarize the values determined above.

**Solution:** A 35% increase in speed (from 23 to 31 mph) results in an 80% increase in kinetic energy and a 100% increase in injury risk. The doubling of injury risk closely matches the doubling of kinetic energy.

---

**Question 5:** Why has the chance of serious injury increased by a larger factor than the speed?

**Solution:** The chance of serious injury is related to the kinetic energy of the car, not just its speed. Since kinetic energy is proportional to speed *squared* (E_k ∝ v²), a relatively small increase in speed produces a much larger increase in kinetic energy. A car at 31 mph has about 1.8× the kinetic energy of one at 23 mph, which closely correlates with the 2× increase in injury risk.

### Exercise 2.2: Ball Kinetic Energies

A 5.00 kg bowling ball at 5.00 m s⁻¹ vs a 0.150 kg cricket ball at 30.0 m s⁻¹.

**Bowling ball kinetic energy:**

**Solution:**
E_k = ½mv² = ½ × 5.00 kg × (5.00 m s⁻¹)²
E_k = ½ × 5.00 × 25.0
E_k = **62.5 J**

---

**Cricket ball kinetic energy:**

**Solution:**
E_k = ½mv² = ½ × 0.150 kg × (30.0 m s⁻¹)²
E_k = ½ × 0.150 × 900
E_k = **67.5 J**

**The cricket ball has slightly more kinetic energy despite being much lighter!** This demonstrates the powerful effect of the v² term - the cricket ball's 6× higher speed more than compensates for its 33× smaller mass.

### Problem 2.2: Potential Energy Sources

**Balanced rock potential energy stems from:**

**Solution:** **Gravity** - The rock has gravitational potential energy due to its position above the ground.

---

**Battery potential energy stems from:**

**Solution:** **Electrostatic forces** - The battery stores chemical energy, which originates from the electrical (electrostatic) forces between charged particles in the chemical compounds.

---

**Drawn longbow potential energy stems from:**

**Solution:** **Elastic forces** - The bent bow has elastic potential energy stored in the deformed wood and string.

---

**Guitar string potential energy stems from:**

**Solution:** **Elastic forces** - The stretched/displaced string has elastic potential energy from the tension in the string.

### Exercise 2.3: Skier Speed Calculation

A skier starts at u = 10 m s⁻¹ at 2500 m height and descends to 2400 m.

**Step 1:** Write the energy conservation equation

**Solution:**
½v² - ½u² = g(h_top - h_bottom) = gΔh

Note: The mass m cancels from both sides!

---

**Step 2:** Calculate the change in height

**Solution:**
Δh = h_top - h_bottom = 2500 m - 2400 m = **100 m**

---

**Step 3:** Rearrange and solve for v

**Solution:**
v² - u² = 2gΔh
v² = u² + 2gΔh
v² = (10)² + 2 × 9.81 × 100
v² = 100 + 1962
v² = 2062
v = √2062 = **45 m s⁻¹** (to 2 significant figures)

### Problem 2.3: Proton and Electron Interactions

Which statements are true?
- Protons are attracted to protons
- Protons are attracted to electrons
- Electrons repel electrons

**Solution:**
- Protons are attracted to protons: **FALSE** (like charges repel)
- Protons are attracted to electrons: **TRUE** (opposite charges attract)
- Electrons repel electrons: **TRUE** (like charges repel)

---

### Problem 2.4: Battery Charge Calculation

If 1 A = 1 C s⁻¹, how much charge does a fully charged 860 mAh battery hold?

**Solution:**
- 860 mAh = 0.860 Ah
- 1 Ah = 1 A × 1 hour = 1 C s⁻¹ × 3600 s = 3600 C
- Total charge = 0.860 × 3600 C = **3096 C** ≈ **3.1 × 10³ C**

---

### Problem 2.5: Anion Charge

What is the charge of an anion with two extra electrons?

**Solution:**
- Each electron has charge -1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
- Two extra electrons: Q = 2 × (-1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) = **-3.204 × 10⁻¹⁹ C**

---

### Problem 2.6: Anion Potential Energy in Cell

What is the potential energy of an anion with one extra electron inside a cell? (membrane potential = -70 mV)

**Solution:**
Using E_el = VQ:
- V = -70 mV = -70 × 10⁻³ V = -0.070 V
- Q = -1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C (one extra electron)

E_el = (-0.070 V) × (-1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)
E_el = **+1.12 × 10⁻²⁰ J**

The positive value means the anion has higher potential energy inside the cell - it "wants" to leave (roll down the potential hill).

## Activities

### Activity 2.1 Identifying examples of kinetic energy

### Activity 2.2 Planetary orbits - Example (Jupiter)

**Jupiter at Perihelion:**
- Mass: 1.898 × 10²⁷ kg
- Distance: 7.41 × 10¹¹ m
- Speed: 13.72 km s⁻¹ = 1.372 × 10⁴ m s⁻¹

**Potential Energy:**
E_g = -GMm/r = -(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹)(1.99 × 10³⁰)(1.898 × 10²⁷)/(7.41 × 10¹¹)
E_g = **-3.40 × 10³⁵ J**

**Kinetic Energy:**
E_k = ½mv² = ½(1.898 × 10²⁷)(1.372 × 10⁴)²
E_k = **1.79 × 10³⁵ J**

**Total Energy:**
E_total = E_k + E_g = 1.79 × 10³⁵ + (-3.40 × 10³⁵) = **-1.61 × 10³⁵ J**

**Key observation:** The total energy is the SAME at perihelion and aphelion (conservation of energy), even though the individual E_k and E_g values differ.

## Summary

1. E_k = ½mv² - kinetic energy depends on mass and speed squared
2. E_g = mgh - gravitational PE near Earth's surface
3. E_g,planet = -GMm/r - gravitational PE for orbits (always negative)
4. E_el = VQ - electrical potential energy
5. Total energy (E_k + E_g) is conserved in isolated systems
6. The v² dependence means doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy
