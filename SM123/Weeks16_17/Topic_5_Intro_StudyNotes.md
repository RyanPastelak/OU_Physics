# Topic 5 Introduction: Energy in Society

## Summary

Energy in society extends beyond science into economics and politics. This topic examines three key aspects:
1. Where our energy comes from
2. How we use it to keep homes warm
3. How we use it for transportation

## Topic Structure

| Part | Content | Time (hours) |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Part 1 | Energy resources | 5 |
| Part 2 | Domestic energy | 3 |
| Part 3 | Energy in transport | 4.5 |

## Key Themes

- **Part 1**: Fossil fuels produce CO₂ (greenhouse gas); nuclear power via E = mc²; renewable sources
- **Part 2**: Heat transfer through conduction, convection, and radiation; insulation
- **Part 3**: Rolling resistance, air resistance, friction; why speed increases fuel consumption

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Account for energy released by burning fossil fuels
- Explain how CO₂ is a necessary by-product
- Use E = mc² to understand nuclear fission energy release
- Explain conduction, convection, radiation, and insulation
- Describe factors affecting fuel usage in transport
- Use thermal conductivity in calculations
- Represent conduction and radiation mathematically
- Investigate how dissipative forces scale with speed
