# Topic 3 Part 4: Covalent Bonding

## Summary

Covalent bonding occurs when atoms **share electrons** rather than transfer them. This is most common between non-metal atoms. Sharing electrons allows each atom to achieve a noble gas configuration. Covalent bonds form molecules, which can range from simple diatomic molecules to giant structures.

## Key Concepts

### Covalent Bonds
- Atoms **share** pairs of electrons
- Each shared pair = one covalent bond
- Atoms gain access to more electrons
- Achieve noble gas electron configuration
- Form discrete **molecules**

### Lewis Structures
- Show outer electrons as dots (•) or crosses (×)
- Different symbols for electrons from different atoms
- Shared pair between atoms = covalent bond
- Single line (—) represents shared electron pair
- **Lone pairs**: Non-bonding electron pairs

### Number of Covalent Bonds

| Element | Outer Electrons | Bonds Needed | Examples |
|---------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| H | 1 | 1 | H₂, H₂O |
| F, Cl, Br | 7 | 1 | F₂, HCl |
| O, S | 6 | 2 | H₂O, O₂ |
| N | 5 | 3 | N₂, NH₃ |
| C | 4 | 4 | CH₄, CO₂ |

### Simple Molecules
- **Diatomic**: Two atoms bonded (H₂, O₂, N₂, F₂, Cl₂)
- **Polyatomic**: Multiple atoms (H₂O, CH₄, CO₂)
- Low melting/boiling points (weak intermolecular forces)
- Do not conduct electricity

### Multiple Bonds
- **Single bond**: 1 shared pair (C—C)
- **Double bond**: 2 shared pairs (C=C, O=O)
- **Triple bond**: 3 shared pairs (N≡N)

### Giant Covalent Structures

**Diamond**:
- Each C bonded to 4 other C atoms
- Very hard, very high melting point
- Does not conduct electricity
- Used in cutting tools

**Graphite**:
- Each C bonded to 3 other C atoms
- Layers of hexagonal rings
- Layers slide easily (soft, lubricant)
- **Conducts electricity** (one free electron per C)
- Graphene = single layer of graphite

### Hydrocarbons
- Contain only hydrogen and carbon
- Fuels: methane (CH₄), ethane (C₂H₆), propane (C₃H₈)
- General formula: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ (for simple hydrocarbons)

### Polymers
- Very large molecules made of repeating units
- **Monomer**: Small starting molecule (e.g., ethene)
- **Polymer**: Long chain of monomers (e.g., polyethene)
- Plastics are polymers
- Formed by linking monomers together

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 4.1: Hydrogen Electron Configuration

What is the electron configuration of hydrogen?

**Solution:** **1** - Hydrogen has 1 electron in its first (and only occupied) shell.

---

### Problem 4.2: First Shell Capacity

What is the maximum number of electrons which can be present in the first shell?

**Solution:** **2** electrons maximum

---

### Problem 4.3: Positive Hydrogen Ion

What do you notice about the positive hydrogen ion (H⁺)?

**Solution:** The positive hydrogen ion (H⁺) has **no electrons at all** - it is simply a proton. This is because hydrogen only has one electron to begin with, and when it loses that electron, nothing remains except the nucleus (one proton).

---

### Problem 4.4: Hydrogen Molecule Charge

Would you expect the hydrogen molecule (H₂) to be charged?

**Solution:** **No** - The hydrogen molecule is electrically neutral. Each H atom contributes one electron to the shared pair, and neither atom gains or loses electrons overall. Total protons = 2, total electrons = 2, so charge = 0.

---

### Problem 4.5: H Atoms vs H₂ Molecule

Identify any differences between two separate H atoms and an H₂ molecule.

**Solution:**
- **Two separate H atoms**: Each has 1 electron, each is unstable (incomplete shell)
- **H₂ molecule**: Both atoms share 2 electrons, each effectively has a "full" first shell
- The H₂ molecule is more stable due to the covalent bond
- The atoms in H₂ are held close together; separate atoms can be anywhere
- H₂ has lower energy than two separate H atoms

---

### Problem 4.6: Carbon Bonds

How many covalent bonds does carbon always form?

**Solution:** **4** covalent bonds

Carbon has 4 outer electrons and needs 4 more to achieve a noble gas configuration (8 electrons in outer shell, like neon).

---

### Problem 4.7: Why Carbon Doesn't Form Ions

Why is it difficult for carbon to form ions?

**Solution:** Carbon would need to either:
- **Lose 4 electrons** to form C⁴⁺ (requires enormous energy)
- **Gain 4 electrons** to form C⁴⁻ (difficult to attract 4 extra electrons)

Both options require too much energy. It's much more favorable for carbon to **share electrons** with other atoms through covalent bonding.

### Problem 4.8: Fluorine Electron Configuration

What is the electron configuration of fluorine?

**Solution:** **2, 7** - Fluorine (atomic number 9) has 2 electrons in the first shell and 7 in the second shell.

### Problem 4.9: Nitrogen Electron Configuration

What is the electron configuration of nitrogen?

**Solution:** **2, 5** - Nitrogen (atomic number 7) has 2 electrons in the first shell and 5 in the second shell.

### Problem 4.10: Nitrogen Outer Electrons

How many outer electrons does nitrogen have?

**Solution:** **5** outer electrons

---

### Problem 4.11: Nitrogen Noble Gas Configuration

How many electrons does nitrogen need to have a noble gas configuration?

**Solution:** **3** more electrons (to have 8 in outer shell, like neon)

---

### Problem 4.12: Nitrogen Covalent Bonds

How many covalent bonds can nitrogen form?

**Solution:** **3** covalent bonds (one for each electron it needs to complete its outer shell)

### Problem 4.13: Carbon and Hydrogen

How many hydrogen atoms can one atom of carbon covalently bond to?

**Solution:** **4** hydrogen atoms
