# Topic 6 Part 2: Nuclear Physics

## Summary

This part explores nuclear physics, including the three types of radioactive decay (alpha, beta, gamma), the concept of half-life, and nuclear reactions (fission and fusion). Conservation laws govern all nuclear processes: electric charge, mass number, and energy are always conserved. The binding energy of nuclei explains why certain nuclear transformations occur and release energy.

**Key topics covered:**
- Conservation laws in nuclear processes
- Alpha-decay: emission of helium-4 nuclei
- Beta-decay: transformations involving neutrons and protons
- Gamma-decay: emission of high-energy photons
- Radioactive half-life and dating techniques
- Background radiation and measurement uncertainty
- Nuclear fission and fusion

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| P = (½)ⁿ × P₀ | Half-life decay (Eqn 2.1a) | Parent atoms after n half-lives |
| P/P₀ = (½)ⁿ | Proportion remaining (Eqn 2.1b) | Fraction of parent atoms remaining |
| P = 2⁻ⁿ × P₀ | Alternative form (Eqn 2.1c) | Equivalent expression |
| D = P₀ - P | Daughter atoms (Eqn 2.2) | Number of daughter atoms |
| D/P = 2ⁿ - 1 | Daughter-to-parent ratio (Eqn 2.3) | Used in dating |
| S = C - B | Background subtraction (Eqn 2.4) | Count from sample alone |

## Key Concepts

### Conservation Laws
In all nuclear processes:
1. **Electric charge is conserved**: Net charge of products = net charge of original
2. **Mass number is conserved**: Total nucleons in products = total nucleons originally
3. **Energy is conserved**: Including mass-energy equivalence (E = mc²)

### Binding Energy
- **Mass defect**: A nucleus is less massive than its constituent nucleons
- **Binding energy**: Energy released when forming a nucleus from its nucleons
- **Most stable nucleus**: Iron-56 has highest binding energy per nucleon (8.8 MeV)
- **Binding energy of He-4**: 28.3 MeV (7.1 MeV per nucleon)

### Alpha-Decay (α-decay)
- Alpha particle = helium-4 nucleus (2 protons, 2 neutrons)
- Atomic number decreases by 2, mass number decreases by 4
- Example: ²³⁴U → ²³⁰Th + ⁴He + energy

### Beta-Decay (β-decay)
Three types:
1. **Beta-minus (β⁻) decay**: Neutron → proton + electron + electron antineutrino
   - Atomic number increases by 1, mass number unchanged
   - Example: ²¹⁴Pb → ²¹⁴Bi + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ

2. **Beta-plus (β⁺) decay**: Proton → neutron + positron + electron neutrino
   - Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number unchanged
   - Example: ¹⁴O → ¹⁴N + e⁺ + νₑ

3. **Electron capture**: Proton + electron → neutron + electron neutrino
   - Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number unchanged
   - Example: ²⁶Al + e⁻ → ²⁶Mg + νₑ

### Gamma-Decay (γ-decay)
- Nucleus transitions from excited state to lower energy state
- Emits gamma-ray photon (energy ~1 MeV)
- No change in atomic number or mass number
- Example: Excited ¹³⁷Ba → ¹³⁷Ba + γ (662 keV)

### Half-life
- Time for half of radioactive atoms to decay
- Completely random for individual atoms, predictable for large samples
- Ranges from fractions of seconds to billions of years

### Background Radiation
- Radioactivity present everywhere from natural sources
- Measurements vary due to random nature of decay
- Uncertainty in count n is approximately √n

### Nuclear Fission
- Heavy nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei
- Releases energy and excess neutrons
- Can sustain chain reactions (nuclear reactors, weapons)
- Example: ²³⁵U + n → ⁹⁹Sr + ¹³⁵Xe + 2n

### Nuclear Fusion
- Light nuclei join to form heavier nuclei
- Powers the Sun (proton-proton chain)
- Requires extremely high temperatures
- Releases energy up to iron-56

## Problems and Activities

### Activity 2.1 Half-life Fractions

What fraction of a sample of parent atoms remains after each of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 half-lives?

**Solution to Activity 2.1**

| Half-lives | Fraction remaining | Percentage |
|------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | 1/2 | 50% |
| 2 | 1/4 | 25% |
| 3 | 1/8 | 12.5% |
| 4 | 1/16 | 6.25% |
| 5 | 1/32 | 3.125% |
| 6 | 1/64 | 1.5625% |
| 7 | 1/128 | 0.78125% |
| 8 | 1/256 | 0.390625% |
| 9 | 1/512 | 0.1953% |
| 10 | 1/1024 | 0.0977% |

### Activity 2.2 Beryllium-11 Decay

The half-life of beryllium-11 is 13.8 seconds. If you started with 1.00 g of this isotope, how much would remain after 82.8 seconds?

**Solution to Activity 2.2**

Number of half-lives: n = 82.8 s / 13.8 s = 6
Remaining mass = 1.00 g × (½)⁶ = 1.00 g × (1/64) = 0.015625 g ≈ 15.6 mg

### Activity 2.3 Iodine-131 Half-life

After 40.0 days, 20.0 mg of an original 640 mg sample of iodine-131 remain. What is the half-life of the iodine-131?

**Solution to Activity 2.3**

P/P₀ = 20.0/640 = 1/32 = (½)⁵, so n = 5 half-lives
Half-life = 40.0 days / 5 = 8.0 days

### Activity 2.4 Sodium-24 Decay

The half-life of sodium-24 is 15 hours. Starting with 45 g, how much would remain after 25 hours?

**Solution to Activity 2.4**

Number of half-lives: n = 25/15 = 5/3 ≈ 1.667
Remaining = 45 g × (½)^(5/3) = 45 g × 0.315 = 14.2 g

### Activity 2.5 Potassium-Argon Dating

A rock contains an argon-40 to potassium-40 ratio of 7.0. How old is the rock? (Half-life of K-40 = 1.25 billion years)

**Solution to Activity 2.5**

D/P = 7.0 = 2ⁿ - 1
2ⁿ = 8
n = 3 half-lives
Age = 3 × 1.25 billion years = 3.75 billion years

### Activity 2.6 Alpha-Decay Energy

The naturally occurring radium isotope ²²⁶Ra (binding energy = 1731.6 MeV) undergoes alpha-decay to a radon isotope ²²²Rn (binding energy = 1708.2 MeV). How much energy is liberated?

**Solution to Activity 2.6**

Total binding energy of products = 1708.2 MeV (Rn) + 28.3 MeV (He) = 1736.5 MeV
Energy liberated = 1736.5 MeV - 1731.6 MeV = 4.9 MeV

### Activity 2.7 Nuclear Fission Products

A uranium-235 nucleus (Z = 92), when struck by a neutron, produces strontium-99 (Z = 38) and one other nucleus, plus two free neutrons. What are the mass number and atomic number of the other nucleus?

**Solution to Activity 2.7**

Before: ²³⁵U + n → A = 236, Z = 92
After: ⁹⁹Sr (Z=38) + ?X + 2n
Mass number of X: 236 - 99 - 2 = 135
Atomic number of X: 92 - 38 = 54 (Xenon)
The other nucleus is ¹³⁵Xe

### Activity 2.8 Triple-Alpha Process

Write an equation for the triple-alpha process in stars.

**Solution to Activity 2.8**

3 × ⁴He → ¹²C

### Activity 2.9 Triple-Alpha Energy

Given that the binding energy of carbon-12 is 92.2 MeV, how much energy is liberated by the triple-alpha process?

**Solution to Activity 2.9**

Binding energy of 3 He-4 nuclei = 3 × 28.3 MeV = 84.9 MeV
Energy liberated = 92.2 MeV - 84.9 MeV = 7.3 MeV
