# Topic 1 Part 1: Elastic Forces

## Summary

This part introduces elastic forces through the fascinating example of kangaroo locomotion. Kangaroos can hop effortlessly due to highly elastic tendons in their legs, which store and release energy like springs. This biological example illustrates the fundamental physics of elastic forces governed by Hooke's law.

**Key topics covered:**
- **Newton's First Law**: Objects remain at rest or move at constant speed unless acted upon by an unbalanced force
- **Equilibrium**: When forces are balanced (static = at rest, dynamic = constant speed)
- **Weight**: The force of gravity on an object (W = mg)
- **Hooke's Law**: The linear relationship between force and extension in elastic materials
- **Free-body Diagrams**: Abstract representations showing all forces on an object
- **Normal Reaction Force**: The perpendicular force surfaces exert to prevent objects passing through
- **Tension**: The force in stretched ropes, cables, and strings

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| v = d/t | Average Speed | Speed equals distance divided by time |
| W = mg | Weight | Weight equals mass times gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m s⁻²) |
| F_str = k_s × x | Hooke's Law | Applied force equals spring constant times extension |
| x = F_str / k_s | Extension | Rearranged Hooke's law to find extension |
| k_s = F_str / x | Spring Constant | Rearranged Hooke's law to find spring constant |

## Key Concepts

- **Newton's First Law**: An object remains at rest, or moves in a straight line at constant speed, unless acted on by an unbalanced force

- **Balanced vs Unbalanced Forces**: Forces are balanced when equal in size but opposite in direction; unbalanced forces cause changes in motion

- **Static Equilibrium**: Object at rest with balanced forces

- **Dynamic Equilibrium**: Object moving at constant speed with balanced forces

- **Weight vs Mass**: Mass is the amount of matter; weight is the gravitational force on that matter (W = mg downwards)

- **SI Unit of Force**: The newton (N) = 1 kg m s⁻²

- **Spring Constant (k_s)**: A measure of stiffness - larger values mean harder to extend/compress

- **Hooke's Law**: Applies to all elastic objects (springs, elastic bands, tendons); works for both extension and compression

- **Free-body Diagram**: A diagram showing all forces acting on a single object, represented as arrows with appropriate lengths and directions

- **Normal Reaction Force**: Arises from atomic bonds acting like tiny springs when compressed; acts perpendicular to surface

- **Tension**: Force in a rope/cable when pulled; originates from stretched atomic bonds acting like springs

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1.1: Average Speed Calculation

A science student is walking briskly and travels 2.30 metres in 2.00 seconds. Calculate the student's average speed.

- (a) 2.30 m s⁻¹
- (b) 2.00 m s⁻¹
- (c) 1.15 m s⁻¹
- (d) 4.60 m s⁻¹

**Solution:** Using v = d/t = 2.30 m / 2.00 s = **1.15 m s⁻¹** (Answer: c)

### Problem 1.2: Speed of Discarded Sachets (Video 1.1)

What do you observe about the speed of the discarded sachets in the ISS video? What does that tell you about whether the forces are balanced or unbalanced?

**Solution:** The sachets move at constant speed in a straight line after being discarded. This indicates that no unbalanced force is acting on them. This is even clearer with the macadamia nut, which moves in a straight line at constant speed until it encounters the force of the astronaut's finger.

### Problem 1.3: Weight of an Apple

Estimate the weight of an apple of mass 100 g, assuming the acceleration due to gravity is 10 m s⁻².

**Solution:** 
First convert mass to kg: 100 g = 0.1 kg
W = mg = 0.1 kg × 10 m s⁻² = **1 N**

(This is why 1 N is sometimes referred to as roughly "the weight of an apple")

### Problem 1.4: Gradient Units

What are the correct units for the gradient (of a force vs extension graph)?

- (a) N m⁻¹
- (b) m N⁻¹
- (c) N m
- (d) N⁻¹ m⁻¹

**Solution:** The gradient = rise/run = force/extension = N/m = **N m⁻¹** (Answer: a)

This is the spring constant k_s.

### Problem 1.5: Spring Extensions

Two springs, A and B, have spring constants of 100 N m⁻¹ and 10 N m⁻¹ respectively. If a force of 10 N acts on both springs, what is the extension of both springs?

**Solution:** Using x = F/k_s:
- Spring A: x = 10 N / 100 N m⁻¹ = **0.1 m**
- Spring B: x = 10 N / 10 N m⁻¹ = **1 m**

The spring with the smaller spring constant extends more for the same force.

### Problem 1.6: Free-Body Diagram for Toy Car

Two children are playing with a toy car. One child pulls the car with a horizontal force of 10 N to the right, and the other with a horizontal force of 20 N in the opposite direction. Which free-body diagram best represents the forces on the toy car?

**Solution:** The correct free-body diagram shows:
- An arrow of length 10 N pointing to the right
- An arrow of length 20 N pointing to the left
- The arrows should be different lengths (the 20 N arrow is twice as long as the 10 N arrow)
- The net force is 10 N to the left, so the car accelerates to the left

### Problem 1.7: Free-Body Diagram for Compressed Spring Platform

Draw a free-body diagram representing the forces on the platform that someone is standing on (compressing a spring).

**Solution:** The free-body diagram should show:
- **Weight (W)** acting downwards from the center of the platform
- **Spring force (F_spring)** acting upwards from the spring
- If in equilibrium, both arrows should be the same length (forces balanced)

---

### Problem 1.8: Weight and Spring Force Calculation

Assuming I have a mass of 90 kg, and using g = 9.81 m s⁻², calculate my weight and determine the force associated with the spring. (Hint: I am in equilibrium.)

**Solution:**
- Weight: W = mg = 90 kg × 9.81 m s⁻² = **882.9 N** (or approximately 883 N downwards)
- Since the person is in equilibrium, the spring force must balance the weight
- Spring force = **882.9 N upwards**

### Problem 1.9: Free-Body Diagram for Can of Beans

Draw a free-body diagram representing a can of beans sitting on a work surface.

**Solution:** The free-body diagram should show:
- **Weight (W)** acting downwards from the center of the can
- **Normal reaction force (N)** acting upwards from the surface
- Both arrows should be the same length (since the can is in equilibrium)
- For a 500 g can: W = 0.5 kg × 9.81 m s⁻² ≈ 5 N

### Problem 1.10: Tension in Crane Cable

A container of mass 9.00 × 10³ kg is attached to a crane via a metal cable. Calculate the tension in the cable.

**Solution:**
The container is in equilibrium (stationary), so tension = weight.
- W = mg = 9.00 × 10³ kg × 9.81 m s⁻²
- W = **8.83 × 10⁴ N** (or 88,300 N)
- Therefore, tension T = **8.83 × 10⁴ N** (or approximately 88 kN)

### Problem 1.11: Kangaroo Achilles Tendon Force

The spring constant of the Achilles tendon of a 50 kg-kangaroo's leg is 8.9 × 10⁴ N m⁻¹. At one point during a hop, the Achilles tendon in the leg is stretched by 6.0 cm. Use Hooke's law to calculate the force in this tendon.

- (a) 60 N
- (b) 5300 N
- (c) 42 000 N
- (d) 89 000 N

**Solution:**
First convert extension to metres: 6.0 cm = 0.060 m
Using F = k × x:
F = 8.9 × 10⁴ N m⁻¹ × 0.060 m = **5340 N** ≈ 5300 N (Answer: b)

## Activities

### Activity 1.1 Investigating the properties of an elastic band

Allow approximately 1 hour

**Aim**
To determine the properties of an elastic band.

**Equipment required**
- A heavy duty elastic band (approximately 8 cm long and 0.5 cm wide)
- Kitchen scales
- An empty plastic drinks bottle (250-500 ml) with screw-top lid
- Sticky tape
- Scissors
- String
- Ruler
- Chopping board (or flat surface)
- Safety goggles

**Safety information**
- Use a plastic bottle, NOT glass
- Do NOT lift bottle above fragile items, people, or animals
- Wear safety goggles (elastic band may break)

**Method**
1. Cut two 10 cm pieces of string and tie in loops around the elastic band
2. Tape one loop to the bottle lid
3. Fill bottle with 250 ml water, screw lid on
4. Weigh the bottle (kg) and record mass
5. Lift bottle ~5 mm off surface using the free string loop, wait for it to stop swinging
6. Measure length of elastic band (m) and record
7. Pour out ~50 ml water
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until bottle is empty (including weighing empty bottle)
9. Record unstretched length (bottle touching board, band not slack)

**Task 2: Analyse your data**
- Calculate forces: W = mg (use g = 9.81 m s⁻²)
- Calculate extensions: stretched length - unstretched length
- Plot graph: weight (W) on y-axis, extension (x) on x-axis
- Fit straight line to data
- Calculate gradient = spring constant (units: N m⁻¹)

**Expected result:** The gradient should be approximately 70 N m⁻¹ for a typical heavy-duty elastic band.
