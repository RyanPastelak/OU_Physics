# Topic 3 Introduction: Material Worlds

## Summary

This topic explores what makes up the materials around us. You'll learn how to use the Periodic Table to understand how atoms combine to form substances with specific, often tailored properties.

**Topic Structure:**
- **Part 1**: The Periodic Table and atomic structure
- **Part 2**: Metals - the most prevalent elements
- **Part 3**: Ionic substances (e.g., common salt)
- **Part 4**: Covalent substances (e.g., fuels, plastics)
