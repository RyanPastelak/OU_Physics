# Topic 9 Introduction: The Evolving Universe

## Summary

Topic 9 focuses on **cosmology**: the science of the origin, development, and future of the Universe. It synthesizes concepts from earlier topics (fundamental forces, atomic physics, astronomy) to explain the Big Bang model. The topic covers the evidence for the **expanding universe** (Hubble's Law), the **cooling universe** (Cosmic Microwave Background), the **evolving universe** (formation of elements and structure), and the mysterious **dark components** (dark matter and dark energy) that dictate its future.

## Key Themes

1.  **The Expanding Universe:**
    -   Discovery that distant galaxies are receding from us.
    -   **Hubble's Law:** Recession speed is proportional to distance.
    -   Interpretation: Space itself is expanding, carrying galaxies with it.

2.  **The Cooling Universe:**
    -   **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** The "afterglow" of the Big Bang.
    -   Black-body radiation at 2.73 K, redshifted from a hot, dense past.

3.  **The Evolving Universe:**
    -   **Fundamental Forces:** Gravity, Electromagnetic, Strong, Weak. Unified at high energies in the early Universe.
    -   **Nucleosynthesis:** Formation of Hydrogen, Helium, and Lithium in the first few minutes.
    -   **Structure Formation:** Gravity pulling matter into clumps to form stars and galaxies.

4.  **The Future:**
    -   The fate of the Universe depends on its density and the influence of Dark Energy (accelerating expansion).

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
-   Explain how galaxy distances and speeds are measured (standard candles, redshift).
-   Describe the **Hubble relationship** and its implication for the age of the Universe.
-   Explain the origin and significance of the **CMB**.
-   Outline the history of the Universe from the Big Bang to today (electroweak unification, inflation, nucleosynthesis, recombination).
-   Discuss the evidence for **Dark Matter** and **Dark Energy**.

## Practical Work

-   **Virtual Telescope:** An online experiment to measure redshifts and brightnesses of galaxies to determine the Hubble Constant ($H_0$).
-   **Black-body Spectra:** Exploring how temperature affects the peak wavelength of emitted radiation.
-   **History of the Universe:** Using an interactive timeline to explore key events.
