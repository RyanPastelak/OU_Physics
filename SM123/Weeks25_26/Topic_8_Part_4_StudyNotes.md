# Topic 8 Part 4: The Moon and Moons

## Summary

This part tours the significant satellites of the Solar System. It starts with Earth's **Moon** (formation, composition, water ice). It then moves to the outer solar system to explore "Ocean Worlds": **Europa** (Jupiter) and **Enceladus** (Saturn), both considered prime candidates for life due to subsurface oceans. Finally, it visits **Titan** (Saturn), a moon with a thick atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes.

## Key Concepts

-   **The Moon:**
    -   **Formation:** Giant Impact Hypothesis (collision with Mars-sized body "Theia").
    -   **Geology:**
        -   **Highlands:** Light, old, anorthosite crust (magma ocean flotation).
        -   **Maria:** Dark, younger, basaltic lava flows filling basins.
    -   **Water:** No liquid water. Ice found in **permanently shadowed craters** at the poles. Source: Comets or solar wind interactions.

-   **Europa (Jupiter):**
    -   Smooth, icy surface with "ball-of-string" cracks.
    -   **Subsurface Ocean:** Liquid salty water beneath the ice shell, maintained by **tidal heating** from Jupiter.
    -   **Habitability:** Potential for life at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor (chemosynthesis).

-   **Enceladus (Saturn):**
    -   Small, icy moon.
    -   **Cryovolcanism:** Geysers of water vapor and ice erupting from "Tiger Stripe" fractures at the south pole.
    -   Confirming a global subsurface ocean with hydrothermal activity.

-   **Titan (Saturn):**
    -   **Atmosphere:** Thick nitrogen/methane atmosphere (orange smog).
    -   **Surface:** Methane/Ethane **lakes** and rivers. Water ice behaves like rock; liquid methane behaves like water.
    -   **Huygens Probe:** Landed in 2005, revealing rounded ice pebbles (river transport) and a "crème brûlée" surface texture.

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Origin of Lunar Water
**Problem:** Where does the ice in lunar polar craters come from?
**Solution:**
1.  **Exogenous:** Impacts from comets/asteroids delivering water.
2.  **Endogenous:** Interaction of Solar Wind protons ($H^+$) with oxygen in lunar minerals to form $OH$ and $H_2O$.
Ice survives because the craters are permanently shadowed (very cold, <100K).

### Question: Why crash Cassini/Galileo?
**Problem:** Why were the Galileo (Jupiter) and Cassini (Saturn) spacecraft deliberately crashed into their planets at end-of-mission?
**Solution:**
To prevent **Planetary Protection** violations. If they ran out of fuel and drifted, they might eventually crash into Europa or Enceladus, potentially contaminating these habitable environments with terrestrial microbes.

## Activities

### Activity 4.1: Virtual Microscope - Lunar Rocks
**Aim:** Identify lunar rock types.
-   **Mare Basalt:** Dark, crystalline, rich in pyroxene/olivine. Vesicular (gas bubbles).
-   **Highland Anorthosite:** Pale, rich in plagioclase feldspar. Ancient crust.
-   **Regolith Breccia:** "Jumbled" texture. Angular fragments of different rocks fused together by impact glass.
