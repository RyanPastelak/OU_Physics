# Topic 6 Part 3: Particle Physics

## Summary

This part delves into the subatomic world of particle physics, revealing that protons and neutrons are composed of fundamental particles called quarks. Electrons and neutrinos belong to a class of fundamental particles called leptons. The strong interaction binds quarks together via gluons, while the weak interaction allows particles to change flavour via W and Z bosons. This deeper understanding explains phenomena from beta-decay to the survival of neutrons in the early Universe.

**Key topics covered:**
- Leptons: electrons, muons, tauons and their neutrinos
- Quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom
- Hadrons: baryons (3 quarks), mesons (quark + antiquark)
- Strong interaction and gluons (quantum chromodynamics)
- Weak interaction and W/Z bosons
- Conservation laws in particle reactions

## Key Concepts

### Leptons
Six fundamental particles (plus their antiparticles):

| Generation | Charged (−e) | Neutral (0) |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| First | Electron (e⁻) | Electron neutrino (νₑ) |
| Second | Muon (μ⁻) | Muon neutrino (ν_μ) |
| Third | Tauon (τ⁻) | Tauon neutrino (ν_τ) |

- Muon: ~200× electron mass
- Tauon: ~3500× electron mass
- Antileptons: e⁺ (positron), μ⁺, τ⁺, ν̄ₑ, ν̄_μ, ν̄_τ

### Quarks
Six flavours (plus their antiquarks):

| Generation | Charge +⅔e | Charge −⅓e |
|------------|------------|------------|
| First | Up (u) | Down (d) |
| Second | Charm (c) | Strange (s) |
| Third | Top (t) | Bottom (b) |

- Antiquarks: ū, d̄, c̄, s̄, t̄, b̄ (opposite charges)
- Quarks are never observed in isolation

### Hadrons
Composite particles made of quarks:

1. **Baryons** (3 quarks):
   - Proton: uud (charge +e)
   - Neutron: udd (charge 0)

2. **Antibaryons** (3 antiquarks):
   - Antiproton: ūūd̄ (charge −e)

3. **Mesons** (quark + antiquark):
   - π⁺: ud̄ (charge +e)
   - π⁻: ūd (charge −e)
   - π⁰: uū or dd̄ (charge 0)

### Strong Interaction
- Binds quarks together inside hadrons
- Mediated by **gluons**
- Very short range (~10⁻¹⁵ m)
- Force equivalent to weight of 10-tonne truck at nuclear distances
- **Colour charge**: red, green, blue (and anticolours)
- All hadrons are "colour-neutral" (white)
- Quarks are confined - never seen in isolation

### Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
- Quantum theory of strong interactions
- Quarks carry colour charge (red, green, or blue)
- Gluons carry colour-anticolour combinations
- **Confinement**: Only colour-neutral combinations can exist independently

### Weak Interaction
- Allows leptons and quarks to change flavour
- Mediated by **W⁺, W⁻, and Z⁰ bosons**
- W± mass: ~80 GeV/c², Z⁰ mass: ~90 GeV/c²
- Responsible for beta-decay

### Conservation Laws

**In strong interactions:**
- Energy conserved
- Electric charge conserved
- Colour charge conserved
- Number of quarks minus antiquarks conserved

**In weak interactions:**
- Energy conserved
- Electric charge conserved
- Number of quarks minus antiquarks conserved
- Number of leptons minus antileptons conserved
- Flavour changing allowed

## Problems and Activities

### Activity 3.1 Antiproton Composition

What is the antiquark composition and charge of an antiproton?

**Solution to Activity 3.1**

Antiproton: ūūd̄
Charge = (−⅔) + (−⅔) + (+⅓) = −e

### Activity 3.2 Neutron Composition

What combination of three up or down quarks would make a neutron?

**Solution to Activity 3.2**

Neutron: udd
Charge = (+⅔) + (−⅓) + (−⅓) = 0

### Activity 3.3 Pion Compositions

What are the compositions of π⁺, π⁻, and π⁰?

**Solution to Activity 3.3**

- π⁺: ud̄ (charge = +⅔ + ⅓ = +e)
- π⁻: ūd (charge = −⅔ − ⅓ = −e)
- π⁰: uū or dd̄ (charge = 0)

### Activity 3.4 Hadron with Charge +2e

How can a single pion combine with a single nucleon to produce a hadron with charge +2e?

**Solution to Activity 3.4**

π⁺ + proton → Δ⁺⁺
(ud̄) + (uud) → (uuu)
Charge: +e + +e = +2e
The Δ⁺⁺ is a baryon (3 quarks).

### Activity 3.5 Proton-Proton Collision Products

Two neutrons collide with 300 MeV kinetic energy. Write all possible pion-producing reactions.

**Solution to Activity 3.5**

1. n + n → n + n + π⁰
2. n + n → n + p + π⁻
3. n + n → p + p + π⁻ + π⁻
4. n + n → n + n + π⁺ + π⁻
5. n + n → n + p + π⁻ + π⁰
6. n + n → p + p + π⁻ + π⁰ (if enough energy)

### Activity 3.6 Colour Charge Changes

(a) A red up quark emits a red-antiblue gluon. What colour charge does the up quark now have?
(b) A green down quark absorbs a blue-antigreen gluon. What colour charge does the down quark now have?

**Solution to Activity 3.6**

(a) Red quark emits red-antiblue → quark becomes blue (lost red, gained blue from antiblue)
(b) Green quark absorbs blue-antigreen → quark becomes blue (green + antigreen cancel, gains blue)

### Activity 3.7 Beta-Minus Decay at Quark Level

Write the quark conversion for beta-minus decay.

**Solution to Activity 3.7**

d → u + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ
Charge: −⅓ → +⅔ + (−1) + 0 ✓

### Activity 3.8 Beta-Plus Decay at Quark Level

Write the quark conversion for beta-plus decay.

**Solution to Activity 3.8**

u → d + e⁺ + νₑ
Charge: +⅔ → −⅓ + (+1) + 0 ✓

### Activity 3.9 Electron Capture at Quark Level

Write the quark conversion for electron capture.

**Solution to Activity 3.9**

u + e⁻ → d + νₑ
Charge: +⅔ + (−1) → −⅓ + 0 ✓

### Activity 3.10 Neutron Survival

If the half-life of a free neutron were 1 second (instead of 10 minutes), how many free neutrons would be left after 3 minutes starting with 10⁶⁸?

**Solution to Activity 3.10**

3 minutes = 180 seconds = 180 half-lives
Remaining = 10⁶⁸ × (½)¹⁸⁰ ≈ 10⁶⁸ × 10⁻⁵⁴ = 10¹⁴

But actually (½)¹⁸⁰ ≈ 10⁻⁵⁴, so ~10¹⁴ neutrons would remain.
(In reality, 10 minutes allows enough neutrons to form helium before decaying.)
