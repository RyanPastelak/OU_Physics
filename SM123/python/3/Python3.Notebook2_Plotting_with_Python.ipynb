    "As the saying goes, ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’. Scientists regularly use graphs and images to both convey basic meaning and ‘explain’ the behaviour of systems, the relationships between quantities and so on. Some of these pictures can be drawn by hand, and being able to sketch a graph is a useful skill to develop. Nowadays, however, most people use specialised software to draw graphs. You may have your preferred package, but Python also provides the facility to not just plot, but also analyse the data you plot. You are going to use one of its plotting packages and a few commands to sketch graphs with Python."

    "Python provides a package called `matplotlib` that contains the module `pyplot`. This module comprises commands for plotting graphs. \n",
    "To use commands from the `pyplot` module you can import the whole module, as you did with the `numpy` package in Python 2 Notebook 3, Section 3.1. The commands you will use most often are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <code>plot(array of independent variables on horizontal axis, array of dependent variables on vertical axis)</code>: two sets of numbers must be provided in the brackets; the second set of numbers may be calculated from the first set using a mathematical function. \n",
    "* <code>title(text for the title)</code>: the text for the title should go in the brackets in between quotation marks. This generates a title for the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below demonstrates how these commands can be used to produce a simple graph. (The graph is really just a sketch as a number of things are missing; for example, the axes are not labelled)."

You can test removing the `\\` symbol and putting all the numbers in a single line."
