# Topic 9 Part 2: The Cooling Universe

## Summary

This part presents the evidence that the Universe was hot in the past. It introduces **black-body radiation**, linking the temperature of an object to the peak wavelength of light it emits (**Wien's Law**). It then describes the **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**, the pervasive radiation field discovered by Penzias and Wilson. The CMB's black-body spectrum at 2.73 K is the redshifted relic of the hot early Universe, confirming the **Hot Big Bang** model.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| $\lambda_{peak} T \approx 2.9 \times 10^3 \mu\text{m K}$ | Wien's Law | Peak wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature. |
| $E_{peak} \approx (4 \times 10^{-4} \text{ eV K}^{-1}) T$ | Peak Energy | Peak photon energy is proportional to temperature. |
| $z \approx 1000$ | CMB Redshift | The factor by which the Universe has expanded since the CMB was emitted. |

## Key Concepts

-   **Black-Body Radiation:**
    -   Ideal emitter of radiation. Spectrum shape depends ONLY on temperature.
    -   **Hotter objects:** Peak at shorter wavelengths (bluer), emit more total energy.
    -   **Cooler objects:** Peak at longer wavelengths (redder/infrared).

-   **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):**
    -   Discovered in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson (Bell Labs).
    -   Observed in all directions (isotropic).
    -   **Spectrum:** Perfect black-body with $T = 2.73 \text{ K}$.
    -   **Origin:** "Afterglow" of the Big Bang. Emitted when the Universe was ~3000 K (visible light). Expansion of space by factor ~1000 has stretched the waves to microwaves ($z \approx 1000$).

-   **Hot Big Bang:**
    -   Evidence 1: **Expansion** (Hubble's Law) $\to$ Universe was denser in past.
    -   Evidence 2: **CMB** $\to$ Universe was hotter in past.
    -   Implies a beginning at finite time in the past.

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Wien's Law
**Problem:** The Sun has surface temperature $T \approx 5800 \text{ K}$. What is its peak wavelength?
**Solution:**
$\lambda_{peak} = \frac{2.9 \times 10^3}{5800} \approx 0.5 \mu\text{m} = 500 \text{ nm}$.
This is in the **visible** spectrum (green-yellow), which is why our eyes evolved to see this range.

### Question: CMB Energy
**Problem:** What temperature corresponds to a peak photon energy of 1 eV (visible/IR boundary)?
**Solution:**
$T = \frac{1 \text{ eV}}{4 \times 10^{-4}} = 2500 \text{ K}$.
This confirms that when the Universe was ~3000 K, it was glowing in visible/IR light.

### Activity 2.1: Black-Body Spectra
**Observations:**
-   As $T$ increases, peak moves left (shorter $\lambda$).
-   As $T$ decreases, peak moves right (longer $\lambda$).
-   Spectrum of 3000 K peaks at ~1 $\mu$m (IR).
-   Spectrum of 3 K peaks at ~1 mm (Microwave).

## Historical Figures
-   **Georges Lemaître:** Proposed "primeval atom" (Big Bang) theory (1927).
-   **George Gamow:** Predicted the CMB.
-   **Fred Hoyle:** Coined the term "Big Bang" (ironically, as he supported Steady State theory).
-   **Penzias & Wilson:** Discovered CMB (Nobel Prize).
