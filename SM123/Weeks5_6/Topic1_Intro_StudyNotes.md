# Topic 1 Introduction: Forces Around You

## Summary

Forces are fundamental to understanding the physical world, controlling both the stability and motion of everything from the largest galaxies to the smallest biological cell structures. At its simplest, a force can be thought of as a push or a pull. This topic examines the role of forces across multiple scientific disciplines, governed by Newton's laws of motion.

**Topic Structure:**
- **Part 1**: Elastic forces - surprisingly widespread in everyday life
- **Part 2**: Forces associated with motion
- **Part 3**: Electromagnetic forces - the origin of most everyday forces

**Estimated Study Times:**
| Part | Content | Time (hours) |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Part 1 | Elastic forces | 4 |
| Part 2 | Forces and motion | 4.5 |
| Part 3 | Electromagnetic forces | 3 |
| Review | Summary activity | 1.5 |

## Key Concepts

- **Forces**: Pushes or pulls that control stability and motion of objects
- **Newton's Laws of Motion**: The fundamental laws governing forces in everyday life
- **Elastic Forces**: Forces associated with stretching and compression (Part 1)
- **Forces and Motion**: Frictional forces, thrust, air resistance (Part 2)
- **Electromagnetic Forces**: Electric and magnetic forces that underlie most everyday phenomena (Part 3)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:

1. Demonstrate understanding of elastic forces, Hooke's law, free-body diagrams, compression, tension, and normal reaction forces
2. Understand frictional forces and resolving forces
3. Apply Newton's three laws of motion
4. Understand electric and magnetic forces and fields
5. Plot graphs and fit straight lines during practical work
6. Use free-body diagrams to represent forces on objects
7. Apply mathematical skills to calculate forces on real objects

## Practical Work Overview

| Part | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| Part 1 | 1 hour | Activity 1.1: Investigating the properties of an elastic band |
| Part 2 | 1 hour | Activity 2.2: Measuring the coefficient of friction |
| Review | 1.5 hours | Summary activity: Forces in the everyday world |

**Activity 1.1**: Determine how the extension of an elastic band changes with force using everyday household materials.

**Activity 2.2**: Use common kitchen objects to measure the coefficient of friction between a can and a chopping board.

**Summary Activity**: Identify real-world situations where forces are acting, photograph/sketch them, and share results with your tutor group.
