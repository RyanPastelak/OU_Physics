# Topic 8 Part 2: Asteroids and Meteorites

## Summary

This part examines the rocky debris of the inner Solar System. It covers **asteroids** (the main belt, Kirkwood gaps, and families) and their classification based on spectra (C-type, S-type, M-type). It links asteroids to **meteorites** found on Earth, using meteorites to date the Solar System and understand processes like differentiation. The Dawn mission to **Vesta** and **Ceres** provides case studies of two very different asteroid worlds.

## Key Concepts

-   **Asteroids:**
    -   **Main Belt:** Between Mars (1.5 AU) and Jupiter (5.2 AU).
    -   **Kirkwood Gaps:** Emptier regions in the belt caused by orbital resonances with Jupiter.
    -   **Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs):** Orbits cross or come near Earth's.
    -   **Classification:**
        -   **C-type:** Carbonaceous, dark, primitive (e.g., Mathilde, Ceres).
        -   **S-type:** Stony, silicate-rich (e.g., Eros).
        -   **M-type:** Metallic (Iron/Nickel).
        -   **V-type:** Basaltic (fragments of Vesta).

-   **Meteorites:**
    -   **Chondrites (Primitive):** Unmelted, contain **chondrules** (silicate droplets) and **CAIs** (oldest solids, 4567 Ma). Composition matches the Sun (minus gas).
    -   **Achondrites (Processed):** From differentiated bodies (crust/mantle). Similar to terrestrial igneous rocks.
    -   **Iron/Stony-Iron:** From the cores of disrupted differentiated bodies.

-   **Dawn Mission:**
    -   **Vesta:** Differentiated, rocky, huge impact crater (Rheasilvia). Source of HED meteorites.
    -   **Ceres:** Dwarf planet, primitive C-type, undifferentiated but water-rich. Features "bright spots" (salt deposits) indicating subsurface brine/ice.

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Density and Structure
**Problem:** Asteroid Mathilde has density $\rho \approx 1300 \text{ kg m}^{-3}$. Its rock components have $\rho \approx 2800 \text{ kg m}^{-3}$. What does this imply?
**Solution:**
Mathilde is a **rubble pile**. It is not a solid rock but a loose accumulation of debris held together by gravity, with significant empty space (porosity) between fragments.

### Question: Dating the Solar System
**Problem:** How do we know the age of the Solar System?
**Solution:**
Radiometric dating (U-Pb) of **CAIs** (Calcium-Aluminium-rich Inclusions) in chondritic meteorites.
Age = **4567 Ma** (4.567 billion years).

## Activities

### Activity 2.1: Virtual Microscope - Meteorites
**Aim:** To identify meteorite types from thin sections.
-   **Ordinary Chondrite (H/L/LL):** Visible chondrules (round spheres), abundant metal grains (black in transmitted light, shiny in reflected).
-   **Carbonaceous Chondrite (e.g., Allende):** Dark matrix, CAIs (white irregular shapes), chondrules. Primitive.
-   **Achondrite (e.g., Stannern):** Interlocking crystals (igneous texture), no chondrules, little metal. Look like Earth basalts.
