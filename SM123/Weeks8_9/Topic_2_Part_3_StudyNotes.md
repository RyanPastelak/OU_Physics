# Topic 2 Part 3: Work and Heat

## Summary

Energy gets from one place to another via two mechanisms:

1. **Work**: Energy transfer when a force acts to move or change something
2. **Heat**: Energy transfer due to temperature differences (always hot → cold)

This part also covers temperature and its relationship to microscopic particle motion.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| W = F × l | Work | Force × distance moved in direction of force |
| W = PΔV | Work on gas | Pressure × change in volume |
| P = F/A | Pressure | Force per unit area |
| T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15 | Temperature conversion | Celsius to Kelvin |
| T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15 | Temperature conversion | Kelvin to Celsius |

**Units**:
- Work: J = N × m = kg m² s⁻²
- Pressure: Pa (pascal) = N m⁻²
- 1 J = 1 Pa × m³
- Standard atmospheric pressure: 1.01 × 10⁵ Pa

## Key Concepts

### Work
- **Definition**: Energy transfer by applying a force
- Work = Force × Distance moved in direction of force
- Lifting a box: muscle energy → gravitational PE of box
- Pulling a train: locomotive energy → kinetic energy of train
- Deforming objects: work changes arrangement of particles

### Pressure and Work on Gases
- Pressure = Force / Area
- Work done on gas = Pressure × Change in volume
- Example: Breathing requires ~50 J per breath (500 ml at atmospheric pressure)
- Daily breathing energy: ~1.2 MJ

### Microscopic Energy
- **Particle arrangement** has potential energy associated with it
- **Particle motion** has kinetic energy associated with it
- Gases: particles move freely throughout volume
- Solids: particles vibrate in fixed positions
- Liquids: intermediate behavior

### Heat
- **Definition**: Energy transfer due to temperature difference
- Always flows from hot to cold
- Different from "heat energy" - heat is a transfer process
- Objects at the same temperature exchange no heat

### Temperature
- Measure of how "hot" something is
- Related to average kinetic energy of particles
- **Celsius scale**: Water freezes at 0°C, boils at 100°C
- **Kelvin scale**: Absolute zero = 0 K = -273.15°C

### Absolute Zero
- Temperature at which all particle motion ceases
- The lowest possible temperature
- 0 K = -273.15°C

### Triple Point of Water
- 273.16 K (0.01°C) at 611.2 Pa
- All three phases (solid, liquid, gas) coexist

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 3.1: Units of Work

**What are the SI units of force?**

**Solution:** The newton (N). In base units: 1 N = 1 kg m s⁻²

---

**What is the SI unit of distance?**

**Solution:** The metre (m)

---

**Looking at W = F × l, what are the SI units of work?**

**Solution:** 
Units of work = N × m = **N m** (newton-metres)

In base units: kg m s⁻² × m = **kg m² s⁻²**

---

**What does this tell you about the units of work in terms of J?**

**Solution:** Since 1 J = 1 kg m² s⁻², we can see that:
- **1 J = 1 N m**
- Work is measured in joules, which is the same unit as energy (as expected, since work is an energy transfer)

---

### Problem 3.2: Pressure and Work Units

Using SI base units, show that 1 J = 1 Pa × m³.

**Solution:**
- 1 Pa = 1 N m⁻² = 1 kg m s⁻² × m⁻² = 1 kg m⁻¹ s⁻²
- 1 Pa × m³ = 1 kg m⁻¹ s⁻² × m³ = 1 kg m² s⁻²
- Since 1 J = 1 kg m² s⁻²
- Therefore **1 J = 1 Pa × m³** ✓

### Problem 3.3: Daily Breathing Energy

As an adult, you breathe about 16 times per minute. Calculate your daily energy requirement for breathing.

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Energy per breath
- W = PΔV = 1.01 × 10⁵ Pa × 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ m³
- W = **50.5 J per breath** ≈ 50 J

**Step 2:** Breaths per day
- Breaths per minute = 16
- Minutes per day = 60 × 24 = 1440
- Breaths per day = 16 × 1440 = **23,040 breaths**

**Step 3:** Daily energy
- Daily energy = 50.5 J × 23,040 = 1,163,520 J
- Daily energy = **1.16 MJ** ≈ **1.2 MJ**

### Problem 3.4: Water vs Ice Potential Energy

Is the potential energy of molecules in water different to that of molecules in ice?

**Solution:** **Yes**, the potential energy is different.

In ice, molecules are rigidly fixed in a crystalline structure with specific distances between molecules. In liquid water, molecules can move around and have different average separations. Since the molecular arrangement is different, the potential energy associated with intermolecular forces is different.

To change ice to water requires energy input (latent heat of fusion) which changes the potential energy of the molecules without changing the temperature.

### Problem 3.5: No Heat Transfer

I have two objects in contact. After careful measurements, I determine that no heat was transferred between them. What can you say about their initial temperatures?

**Solution:** The two objects must have been at the **same temperature** initially.

Heat is defined as energy transfer due to a temperature difference. If no heat was transferred, there was no temperature difference between the objects. This is the definition of **thermal equilibrium**.

---

### Problem 3.6: Minimum Temperature

As a substance is cooled, the microscopic motion slows. Give a reason why the temperature cannot go lower than a certain value.

**Solution:** Temperature is related to the average kinetic energy of particle motion. As temperature decreases, particles move more slowly.

At **absolute zero** (0 K = -273.15°C), particles would have the minimum possible energy - they effectively stop moving (in classical terms). Since you cannot have particles moving slower than "stopped," there is a minimum possible temperature.

You cannot remove kinetic energy from particles that have no kinetic energy to remove, so absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature.

### Exercise 3.1: Temperature Conversions

**Question 1a:** Convert ethanol auto-ignition temperature (365°C) to K.

**Solution:**
T(K) = T(°C) + 273 = 365 + 273 = **638 K**

---

**Question 1b:** Convert water-salt solution freezing point (−21°C) to K.

**Solution:**
T(K) = T(°C) + 273 = -21 + 273 = **252 K**

---

**Question 2a:** Convert deep space temperature (2.725 K) to °C.

**Solution:**
T(°C) = T(K) - 273.15 = 2.725 - 273.15 = **-270.425°C** ≈ **-270.4°C**

(Using 273.15 here for precision with the 4-significant-figure input)

---

**Question 2b:** Convert Sun's surface temperature (5778 K) to °C.

**Solution:**
T(°C) = T(K) - 273 = 5778 - 273 = **5505°C**

## Activities

### Activity 3.1 A simple experiment on heat transfer

Find objects of different materials (wood, metal, etc.) at room temperature. Rank them from coolest to warmest by touch.

**Key insight:** Even though all objects are at the same temperature (room temperature), metals feel colder than wood or plastic. This is because metals are better thermal conductors - they transfer heat away from your warm hand more quickly, making them feel colder.

This demonstrates that our sensation of "hot" or "cold" is really sensing the *rate of heat transfer*, not temperature directly.

### Activity 3.2 Gas in a box

Key observations from the simulation:

1. **Higher temperature**: Particles move faster (higher average speed), more energetic collisions with walls
2. **Lower temperature**: Particles move slower, less energetic collisions
3. **Speed distribution**: Most particles have speeds near the average; very few have very high or very low speeds
4. **Energy conservation**: Total energy stays constant even though individual particle energies constantly change due to collisions

## Summary Points

1. **Work** = Force × Distance (W = Fl) - energy transfer via forces
2. **Work on gas** = Pressure × Volume change (W = PΔV)
3. **Heat** = energy transfer due to temperature difference (hot → cold only)
4. **Temperature** reflects average particle kinetic energy
5. **Absolute zero** (0 K = -273.15°C) - minimum possible temperature
6. Particle motion is random but total energy is conserved
7. Friction converts mechanical energy to thermal energy via particle collisions
