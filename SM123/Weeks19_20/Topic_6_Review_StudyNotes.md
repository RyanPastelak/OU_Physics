# Topic 6 Review: Nuclei and Particles

## Summary - Key Learning

In this topic you have been introduced to the physics that operates at the smallest scales:

1. **Atomic Structure**: Nuclei contain protons and neutrons; isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers

2. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: E = mc²; matter and antimatter can annihilate or be created via pair production

3. **Nuclear Decays**:
   - Alpha-decay: Emits He-4 nucleus (Z decreases by 2, A decreases by 4)
   - Beta-decay: Proton ↔ neutron conversions (β⁻, β⁺, electron capture)
   - Gamma-decay: Emits high-energy photon (Z and A unchanged)

4. **Half-life**: Time for half of radioactive sample to decay; P = (½)ⁿP₀

5. **Nuclear Reactions**:
   - Fission: Heavy nuclei split, releasing energy
   - Fusion: Light nuclei combine, releasing energy (powers the Sun)

6. **Particle Structure**:
   - Six leptons (electron, muon, tauon + neutrinos)
   - Six quarks (u, d, c, s, t, b)
   - Hadrons: baryons (3 quarks) and mesons (quark + antiquark)

7. **Fundamental Interactions**:
   - Strong: Binds quarks (gluons), colour charge
   - Weak: Flavour changes (W±, Z⁰ bosons)

### Question 2
A neutron has a mass of 940 MeV/c². What is the minimum energy required to create a neutron–antineutron pair?

**Solution to Question 2**
Minimum energy = 2 × 940 MeV = **1880 MeV**

### Question 3
In the alpha decay: ²⁴⁰Pu → ²³⁶U + ⁴He, the binding energy of He-4 is 28.30 MeV, the binding energy per nucleon of U-236 is 7.587 MeV, and the binding energy per nucleon of Pu-240 is 7.556 MeV. How much energy is released?

**Solution to Question 3**
Binding energy of Pu-240 = 240 × 7.556 = 1813.44 MeV
Binding energy of U-236 = 236 × 7.587 = 1790.53 MeV
Total BE of products = 1790.53 + 28.30 = 1818.83 MeV
Energy released = 1818.83 - 1813.44 = **5.39 MeV**

### Question 4
The sodium isotope ²²Na undergoes electron capture to form an isotope of neon. What are the atomic number and mass number of the neon isotope?

**Solution to Question 4**
Electron capture: Z decreases by 1, A unchanged
**Z = 10, A = 22** (²²Ne)

### Question 5
An experiment starts with 100 mg of thulium-167. After 74 days, only 0.39 mg remains. What is the half-life?

**Solution to Question 5**
P/P₀ = 0.39/100 = 0.0039 ≈ 1/256 = (½)⁸
n = 8 half-lives
Half-life = 74 days / 8 = **9.25 days**

### Question 6
A radioactive count rate (including background) is 240 c/s. Background is 16 c/s. What is the best estimate of the background-subtracted count rate and its uncertainty?

**Solution to Question 6**
S = C - B = 240 - 16 = 224 c/s
Uncertainty = √(C + B) = √(240 + 16) = √256 = 16 c/s
**224 ± 16 c/s**

### Question 7
A subatomic particle has quark composition 'csd'. What type of particle is this and what is its electric charge?

**Solution to Question 7**
Three quarks → **baryon**
Charge = (+⅔) + (−⅓) + (−⅓) = **0**
