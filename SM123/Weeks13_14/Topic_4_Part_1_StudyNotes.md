# Topic 4 Part 1: Features of Quantum Mechanics

## Summary

Three fundamental ideas underpin quantum mechanics:

1. **Wave-particle duality**: Objects behave as both waves AND particles
2. **Quantisation**: Objects can only have fixed amounts of energy (quanta)
3. **Probability**: Behaviour is governed by the laws of chance

These counter-intuitive ideas are essential before examining quantum mechanics in atoms.

## Key Concepts

### Quantum Scale
- **Nanometre (nm)**: 1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m (one-billionth of a metre)
- Objects with sizes less than ~100 nm are governed by quantum mechanics
- Quantum objects: electrons, atoms, quarks, atomic nuclei, neutrons
- NOT quantum (too large): planets, stars, trees, birds, chairs

### Waves and Interference
- **Wavelength**: Distance between successive peaks
- **Amplitude**: Height of peak above equilibrium position
- **Constructive interference**: Peaks meet peaks → double amplitude
- **Destructive interference**: Peaks meet troughs → cancellation

### Wave-Particle Duality
**Double-slit experiment evidence:**
- Electrons or photons pass through two slits
- Pattern on screen shows interference (wave behaviour)
- Individual particles arrive at specific points (particle behaviour)
- Even single particles interfere with themselves!

**Key insight**: Objects act as waves until measured, then behave as particles.

### De Broglie Wavelength
The wavelength associated with any object:

**λ = h/(mv)**

Where:
- λ = de Broglie wavelength (m)
- h = Planck's constant = 6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J s
- m = mass (kg)
- v = speed (m s⁻¹)

**Key point**: Longer wavelengths for slow, low-mass objects. Everyday objects have wavelengths too small to observe quantum effects.

### Light and Photons
- **Electromagnetic spectrum**: Radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, UV, X-rays
- **Visible light**: wavelengths 400-700 nm
- **Frequency**: f = 1/T (Hz) where T = period
- **Wave speed relation**: f = c/λ (for light, c = 3 × 10⁸ m s⁻¹)

**Photon energy:**
**E = hf**

Where:
- E = energy (J)
- h = Planck's constant
- f = frequency (Hz)

### Probability in Quantum Mechanics
- Cannot predict exact outcome of individual measurements
- CAN predict all possible outcomes and their probabilities
- Not experimental limitation - fundamental feature of nature

### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
**Cannot simultaneously know both position AND velocity with arbitrary precision.**

- Know position precisely → know nothing about velocity
- Know velocity precisely → know nothing about position
- Cannot predict future trajectory of quantum objects

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| λ = h/mv | De Broglie wavelength | Wavelength of any object |
| f = 1/T | Frequency | Frequency from period |
| f = c/λ | Wave frequency | For electromagnetic radiation |
| E = hf | Photon energy | Energy of a photon |

## Constants

| Constant | Symbol | Value |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Planck's constant | h | 6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J s |
| Speed of light | c | 3.00 × 10⁸ m s⁻¹ |

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1.1: Quantum-Sized Objects

Which objects are governed by quantum mechanics (size < 100 nm)?

**Solution:**
**Governed by quantum mechanics:**
- Electrons (≈ 10⁻¹⁵ m or smaller)
- Atoms (≈ 0.1 nm = 10⁻¹⁰ m)
- Quarks (point-like)
- Nucleus of an atom (≈ 10⁻¹⁵ m)
- Neutrons (≈ 10⁻¹⁵ m)

**NOT governed by quantum mechanics (too large):**
- Planets (≈ 10⁶-10⁸ m)
- Stars (≈ 10⁸-10¹² m)
- Trees (≈ 10 m)
- Birds (≈ 0.1 m)
- Chairs (≈ 1 m)

### Problem 1.2: De Broglie Wavelength of an Electron

Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron (mass = 9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg) moving at 1.0 × 10⁶ m s⁻¹.

**Solution:**
λ = h/(mv)
λ = (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J s) / (9.11 × 10⁻³¹ kg × 1.0 × 10⁶ m s⁻¹)
λ = (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴) / (9.11 × 10⁻²⁵)
λ = **7.3 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 0.73 nm**

This is about the size of an atom, so quantum effects are significant.

### Problem 1.3: Photon Energy Calculation

Calculate the energy of a photon with wavelength 500 nm (green light).

**Solution:**
First find frequency: f = c/λ
f = (3.00 × 10⁸ m s⁻¹) / (500 × 10⁻⁹ m)
f = 6.00 × 10¹⁴ Hz

Then find energy: E = hf
E = (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴ J s) × (6.00 × 10¹⁴ Hz)
E = **3.98 × 10⁻¹⁹ J** ≈ **2.5 eV**

### Problem 1.4: De Broglie Wavelength of Everyday Object

Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a tennis ball (mass = 0.057 kg) moving at 50 m s⁻¹.

**Solution:**
λ = h/(mv)
λ = (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴) / (0.057 × 50)
λ = (6.63 × 10⁻³⁴) / (2.85)
λ = **2.3 × 10⁻³⁴ m**

This is ~10⁻²⁵ times smaller than an atom! Far too small to detect, which is why everyday objects don't show quantum behaviour.

### Problem 1.5: Interference Pattern

In a double-slit experiment, what pattern would you expect if light behaved only as particles?

**Solution:** If light behaved only as particles, you would see **two bright bands** directly behind each slit - particles would travel in straight lines through one slit or the other, creating two separate spots.

Instead, we observe an **interference pattern** with alternating bright and dark bands across the screen, proving wave behaviour. The bright bands show constructive interference, dark bands show destructive interference.
