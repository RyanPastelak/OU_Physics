## Activities

### Activity 1

(a) What phenomenon is described by Hooke's law?

(b) What mathematical statements make up this mathematical model?

(c) What predictions does this model allow us to make about the behaviour of this real-world phenomenon?

(d) When you plotted your graph of weight versus extension in Subsection 1.3, you probably didn't quite get a straight line going through both your points and the origin. Can you think of any reasons why that might be?

---

### Activity 2

(a) Use the two points from your experiment in Subsection 1.3 and Equation M2 to determine the gradient of the straight line that joins them.

(b) Use Equation M3, your gradient from part (a) and one of your points to find the equation of the line.

(c) Find the x- and y-intercepts of your line.

(d) Use your x- and y-intercepts, and your two points, to sketch a graph of your linear model.

(e) Comment on the validity of your model when the applied force is 0N.

---

### Activity 3

(a) Write a pair of simultaneous linear equations by substituting each of the points (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂) from your experiment in Subsection 1.3 into the equation y = mx_i + c, where i = 1,2. Each point should give you one equation.

(b) Solve the pair of simultaneous linear equations in part (a) and check that your answer matches your answer to Activity 2 part (b).

### Activity 4

**Context:** Two masses, m₁ = 110g and m₂ = 150g, are attached to either end of a massless, inextensible string, and that the string is resting on a smooth pulley. Initially, m₁ is held 1.3m below the pulley while m₂ is hanging freely 0.30m below the pulley. At time t = 0, m₁ is released and the system moves under the influence of gravity only.

(a) Draw separate free-body diagrams for each of the two masses, labelling the unknown tension of the string T.

(b) Once m₁ is released at t = 0 the masses are not at rest: they are moving with acceleration a and −a. Thus the net force on each mass is not 0, but rather m₁a and −m₂a. Find the net force from each free-body diagram and set each equal to m₁a and −m₂a, thereby writing a pair of linear simultaneous equations in the unknowns T and a. Remember that g = 9.81ms⁻².

(c) Solve the simultaneous equations from part (b) to find T and a.

---

### Activity 5

(a) Write Coulomb's law as a quadratic equation in r, by assuming all values other than r are known. Start by subtracting F_el from both sides of the equation and then rearrange the equation into quadratic form. Identify the values of the constants a, b and c. Is a non-zero as required?

(b) In Subsection 3.1.3 you found that the electric force between the proton and electron at the average distance between them in a hydrogen atom is −8.24×10⁻⁸N. Suppose instead that the electric force were known, and that we wanted to find the average distance between the electron and the proton. Use the quadratic equation you found in part (a) to find this distance of separation, r. Remember that the charge of an electron is −1.602×10⁻¹⁹C, the charge of a proton is 1.602×10⁻¹⁹C and k_e = 8.99×10⁹Nm²C⁻².

(c) Quadratic equations also arise from Coulomb's law in other ways. Suppose two charges separated by a distance of r = 10cm repel each other with a force of 10N. We know that the sum of the charges is (10/9)×10⁻⁵C. What are the two charges? Use k_e = 9×10⁹Nm²C⁻² in this Activity.

**Hint:** Denote the unknown charges by Q₁ and Q₂ and substitute the given values into Coulomb's equation. This gives you one equation with two unknown values. Write the relationship between the size of the charges as a second equation in terms of Q₁ and Q₂, and treat the two equations as simultaneous equations. Solve these using the substitution method.

(d) Sketch a graph of the quadratic equation y = x² − (10/9)×10⁻⁵x + (1/9)×10⁻¹⁰ and comment on the meaning of its x-intercepts.

**Hint:** You may find it helpful to review Unit 2, Subsection 4.9.

## Solutions

### Solution to Activity 1

(a) Hooke's law describes the phenomenon of an elastic object (such as a spring or elastic band) stretching when a force is applied to it.

(b) There is only one mathematical statement in this model, and it is Hooke's law as given by Equation M1.

(c) We can predict how much an elastic object will stretch if we apply a force of a certain size. We can also predict the size of force required to stretch the elastic object a certain amount.

(d) Real elastic bands are unlikely to display the exact linear behaviour of Hooke's law, for example because of the age and shape of the elastic band, how close to its maximum stretched length it gets, the temperature of its surroundings and inaccuracies in measurements. However, a linear model probably describes the behaviour of your elastic band pretty well, and could be used to give useful predictions. In fact, it is much more useful and widely applicable than if you had found a model to describe your particular elastic band more accurately.

The most useful mathematical model is the simplest model that is sufficient for our purposes, and Hooke's law is widely applicable to numerous real-world applications with sufficient accuracy. To achieve such a model we have to assume that a number of properties of the real-world elastic band and its surroundings are negligible. Determining the important aspects to include in a mathematical model, and deciding which can be ignored, is an important skill in mathematical modelling.

Hooke's law is used in many more complex mathematical models. In these we may state as one of our assumptions that elastic parts of our model act as model springs. A model spring is assumed to have an exact linear relationship between force and extension, so this means that we assume that Hooke's law applies.

### Solution to Activity 2

(a) My two points are (0.060m, 5.1N) and (0.029m, 2.6N). The gradient of the straight line that joins these two points is:

m = (y₂−y₁)/(x₂−x₁) = (5.1N−2.6N)/(0.060m−0.029m) = 80.645...Nm⁻¹ ≈ 81Nm⁻¹ (to two sig. figs.)

So the gradient is 81Nm⁻¹.

(b) I am going to use the larger point, (0.060m, 5.1N), and I am going to use the gradient to 5 significant figures within my calculations. Thus the equation of my line is:

y − 5.1N = 80.645Nm⁻¹(x − 0.060m)

Rearranging to make y the subject and rounding the final answer to 2 sig. figs. gives:

y = 81Nm⁻¹x + 0.26N

(c) The x-intercept is the value of x when y = 0. Setting y = 0N gives 0N = 81Nm⁻¹x + 0.26N. Solving this equation gives x = −0.0032m (to two significant figures).

The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. Setting x = 0m gives y = 81Nm⁻¹ × 0m + 0.26N. Solving this equation gives y = 0.26N.

Thus the x-intercept is −0.0032m and the y-intercept is 0.26N.

(d) A sketch of my linear model should show the x- and y-intercepts, the two measured points, be a straight line and have labelled axes with some points marked.

(e) My model predicts an extension of −0.0032m when a force of 0N is applied. This is clearly nonsense! However, it is not that far off the 0m extension we would expect, either. In general, care must be taken when applying mathematical models to ensure they make physical sense, and the models are most reliable when used within (or near) the range of measurements that informed the original model. For example, a prediction of the extension for an applied force of 3N is more likely to be reliable.

### Solution to Activity 3

(a) My two points are (0.060m, 5.1N) and (0.029m, 2.6N), so my two equations become:

5.1N = (0.060m)m + c ... (S1)

2.6N = (0.029m)m + c ... (S2)

(b) Subtracting Equation S2 from Equation S1 gives:

5.1N − 2.6N = (0.060m − 0.029m)m

2.5N = (0.031m)m

m = 80.645...Nm⁻¹ ≈ 81Nm⁻¹

Now substituting this value for m (to 5 sig. figs. in this intermediate calculation) into Equation S1 gives:

5.1N = 0.060m × 80.645Nm⁻¹ + c

c = 5.1N − 0.060m × 80.645Nm⁻¹

c = 0.2631N ≈ 0.26N

This does match the equation we found in Activity 2 (b). Depending on when you did your rounding you may have got a slightly different answer to that in the previous Activity.

### Solution to Activity 4

(a) Free-body diagrams (note all values converted to SI units):

For m₁: Tension T pointing upward, Weight (0.11kg)g pointing downward

For m₂: Tension T pointing upward, Weight (0.15kg)g pointing downward

(b) From the first free-body diagram, the net force on m₁ is T − (0.11kg)g = T − 1.0791N.

Setting this equal to m₁a = (0.11kg)a gives the equation T − 1.0791N = (0.11kg)a.

From the second free-body diagram, the net force on m₂ is T − (0.15kg)g = T − 1.4715N.

Setting this equal to −m₂a = (−0.15kg)a gives the equation T − 1.4715N = (−0.15kg)a.

We thus have the following pair of simultaneous equations:

T − 1.0791N = (0.11kg)a ... (S3)

T − 1.4715N = (−0.15kg)a ... (S4)

(c) Subtracting Equation S4 from Equation S3 gives:

−1.0791N + 1.4715N = (0.11kg + 0.15kg)a

Rearranging to make a the subject gives a = 1.5092ms⁻² (to 5 sig. figs. for intermediate calculations).

Substituting this value for a back into Equation S3 gives T − 1.0791N = 0.1660N.

Rearranging to make T the subject gives T = 1.2451N.

**So the tension in the string is 1.2N, and both masses accelerate at 1.5ms⁻², with m₁ accelerating upwards and m₂ accelerating downwards.**

### Solution to Activity 5

(a) Rearranging as suggested gives k_e(Q₁Q₂)/r² − F_el = 0. Multiplying through by −r² gives:

F_el r² − k_e Q₁Q₂ = 0

This is of the required form for a quadratic equation with a = F_el, b = 0 and c = −k_e Q₁Q₂.

As long as F_el ≠ 0 (if the electric force were equal to zero we would have a rather uninteresting problem!), a ≠ 0 and we have a quadratic.

(b) Substituting in the given values gives:

0 = (−8.24×10⁻⁸N)r² − (8.99×10⁹Nm²C⁻²) × (−1.602×10⁻¹⁹C) × (1.602×10⁻¹⁹C)

0 = (−8.24×10⁻⁸N)r² + (2.3072×10⁻²⁸Nm²)

r² = 0.280×10⁻²⁰m²

r = ±5.29×10⁻¹¹m

Since r is a distance, only the positive value makes sense in this context, so we have, of course, obtained the distance given in the original exercise of **r = 5.29×10⁻¹¹m**.

This also illustrates how the difficulty of finding an unknown value depends on the type of equation that results after substituting in the known values.

(c) Substituting the given values into Coulomb's law, and writing the relationship between the two charges as a second equation, gives the pair of simultaneous equations:

10N = (9×10⁹Nm²C⁻²) × Q₁Q₂/(0.1m)² ... (S5)

Q₁ + Q₂ = (10/9)×10⁻⁵C ... (S6)

Rearranging Equation S6 to make Q₂ the subject gives Q₂ = ((10/9)×10⁻⁵C) − Q₁.

Substituting this in for Q₂ in Equation S5 gives:

10N = (9×10⁹Nm²C⁻²) × Q₁((10/9)×10⁻⁵C − Q₁)/(0.1m)²

Multiplying out the brackets and writing this as a quadratic equation gives:

Q₁² − (10/9)×10⁻⁵C × Q₁ + (1/9)×10⁻¹⁰C² = 0 ... (S7)

(Q₁ − 10⁻⁵C)(Q₁ − (1/9)×10⁻⁵C) = 0

Q₁ = 10⁻⁵C or Q₁ = (1/9)×10⁻⁵C

(You may have decided to use the quadratic formula rather than factorise here.)

Substituting these values into Equation S6 gives the two solutions:

Q₁ = 10⁻⁵C, Q₂ = (1/9)×10⁻⁵C **or**

Q₁ = (1/9)×10⁻⁵C, Q₂ = 10⁻⁵C

As it doesn't matter which of the two charges we label Q₁ and which we label Q₂, we can see that **a pair of charges of sizes (1/9)×10⁻⁵C and 10⁻⁵C meet the requirements**. These repel each other as they have the same sign.

(d) A sketch of the quadratic equation y = x² − (10/9)×10⁻⁵x + (1/9)×10⁻¹⁰:

- The quadratic should be u-shaped since a = 1 is positive
- The y-intercept should be (1/9)×10⁻¹⁰
- The x-intercepts were found in part (c): (1/9)×10⁻⁵ and 10⁻⁵
- The axis of symmetry is at x = ((1/9)×10⁻⁵ + 10⁻⁵)/2 = (5/9)×10⁻⁵
- The vertex is at ((5/9)×10⁻⁵, −(16/81)×10⁻¹⁰)

**The x-intercepts are the values where y = 0, so where Equation S7 is satisfied letting x = Q₁. Thus the x-intercepts are the two possible values of Q₁.**
