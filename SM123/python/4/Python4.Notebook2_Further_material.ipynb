    "Notice a couple of things. First, the name of the variable that is passed to the user-defined function `how_old` (in lines 16 and 17) is `your_year_of_birth`, but this value is assigned to a variable with a different name: `year_of_birth` within the function itself. This demonstrates the feature that was referred to earlier in Python 2 Notebook 2, Section 2.1. The variable outside the function does not have to have the same name as the variable inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, in line 14 I’ve given ‘names’ to the two values the program returns (in this case the names are: `in2026` and `in2000`). That means that when I call the function (i.e. when I use the function), in lines 16 and 17, I need to specify, inside the square brackets, which of the two returned values I want to use in each case. This was not necessary when the user-defined function returned just a single value. However, even in that case (such as the program to calculate the energy of the state of a hydrogen atom in Python 2 Notebook2, Section 2.1), we could also have explicitly written the return statement as: <code>return {'energy_of_state':ener}<code> and then called the function using the syntax: <code>print (\"Energy of the hydrogen state:\",energy(n)['energy_of_state'],\"eV\")</code>.
