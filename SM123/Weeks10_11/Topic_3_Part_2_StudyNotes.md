# Topic 3 Part 2: Focusing on Metals

## Summary

Metals are the largest subset of elements in the Periodic Table. Their unique structure - metal ions in a "sea" of delocalised electrons - explains their characteristic physical properties: shininess, conductivity, malleability, and ductility.

## Key Concepts

### Common Physical Properties of Metals
- **Shiny** (lustrous)
- **Good conductors of heat**
- **Good conductors of electricity**
- **Ductile** (can be drawn into wires)
- **Malleable** (can be hammered into shapes)

### Metallic Structure
- Metal atoms packed tightly together in a lattice
- Outer electrons are **delocalised** - free to move throughout the structure
- Metal ions (positive) surrounded by a "sea" of electrons
- Strong electrostatic attraction holds structure together

### Explaining Properties Through Structure

**Malleability**: Atoms can slide over each other when force is applied, changing shape without breaking bonds

**Ductility**: Metal can elongate under tension because atoms slide and bonds reform

**Thermal Conductivity**: 
- Heating causes atoms to vibrate more vigorously
- Vibrations transfer to neighboring atoms
- Energy spreads through the structure

**Electrical Conductivity**:
- Delocalised electrons move freely
- When voltage applied, electrons flow in one direction
- Creates electrical current

### Material Selection
Balancing properties for specific uses:
- **Copper**: Excellent electrical conductivity, used in domestic wiring
- **Aluminium**: Lower density, cheaper, used in overhead power lines

| Property | Copper | Aluminium |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Density (g cm⁻³) | 8.96 | 2.60 |
| Electrical conductivity | Excellent | Fair |
| Cost per tonne (£) | 3202 | 1060 |

### Structural Failure
- Metal structures can contain **voids** (missing atoms)
- Voids create weak points
- Under stress, cracks propagate from voids
- Eventually leads to structural failure

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 2.1: Aluminium for Power Lines

Look at Table 2.2. Why do you think aluminium is used for overhead power lines?

**Solution:** Aluminium is used for overhead power lines because:
- **Lower density** (2.60 vs 8.96 g cm⁻³) - much lighter than copper
- **Much cheaper** (£1060 vs £3202 per tonne)
- Although its conductivity is only "fair" compared to copper's "excellent," the massive cost and weight savings make it the practical choice
- Lighter cables need less support structure, reducing overall costs

### Problem 2.2: Properties for Different Uses

What physical properties make these metals suitable for their uses?

**Gold jewellery:**
- **Lustrous/shiny** - attractive appearance
- **Malleable** - can be shaped into intricate designs
- **Unreactive** - doesn't tarnish or corrode
- **Ductile** - can be drawn into thin wire for chains

**Aluminium drinks cans:**
- **Malleable** - can be pressed into shape
- **Low density** - lightweight for transport
- **Corrosion resistant** - protects contents
- **Relatively cheap** - economical for mass production

**Iron pans:**
- **High melting point** - won't melt when heated
- **Good thermal conductor** - heats food evenly
- **Strong** - durable with heavy use
- **Relatively cheap** - affordable for cookware

### Problem 2.3: Heating Metal

What happens to the metal when it is heated?

**Solution:** When a metal is heated:
1. **Atoms vibrate more vigorously** about their positions
2. These vibrations are **transferred to neighboring atoms**
3. Energy spreads throughout the structure through this mechanism
4. This is why metals are excellent **thermal conductors**
5. The delocalised electrons also help transfer energy quickly through the structure

### Problem 2.4: Structural Failure from Voids

What happens to the metal when metal atoms are missing, leading to voids in the structure?

**Solution:**
- Voids (missing atoms) create **weak points** in the structure
- When stress is applied, the structure cannot distribute force evenly
- **Cracks can form** starting at these void locations
- Under repeated or excessive stress, cracks **propagate** (grow)
- Eventually leads to **structural failure** (fracture)
- This is why quality control in metal manufacturing is crucial

## Activities

### Activity 2.1 Metals and their uses

Allow approximately 30 minutes

**Examples:**

**Fencing rapiers (steel):**
- Lightweight but strong
- Flexible (won't shatter on impact)
- Can be hammered into thin blade shape
- Shiny appearance

**Foil food trays (aluminium):**
- Thin and light
- Good heat conductor (for cooking)
- Inexpensive for mass production
- High enough melting point for oven use
- Can be moulded into shape

### Summary Activity Answers

**How are metal atoms bonded together?**
Metal atoms are held together by metallic bonding - a "sea" of delocalised electrons surrounds positive metal ions, with strong electrostatic attraction between them.

**How does metallic bonding explain electrical conductivity?**
The delocalised electrons are free to move through the structure. When a voltage is applied, these electrons flow in one direction, creating an electrical current.

**How does metallic bonding explain ductility and malleability?**
The layers of metal atoms can slide over each other when force is applied. The delocalised electrons continue to hold the structure together in its new position, allowing the metal to change shape without breaking.

**How does metallic bonding explain heat conduction?**
When heated, atoms vibrate more energetically. These vibrations transfer to neighboring atoms, spreading thermal energy through the structure. Delocalised electrons also help transfer energy rapidly.

**What happens when metals fail?**
Voids (missing atoms) create weak points. Under stress, cracks form at these points and propagate through the structure, eventually causing fracture.
