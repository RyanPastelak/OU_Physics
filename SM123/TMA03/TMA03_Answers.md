## Question 3: Topic 4 – The Quantum Realm (16 marks)

### Part (a): Orbital Sketches (n = 2)

There are four orbital shapes associated with $n=2$: one $2s$ orbital ($l=0, m_l=0$) and three $2p$ orbitals ($l=1, m_l=-1, 0, +1$).

**1. 2s Orbital ($l=0$)**
*   **Horizontal Cross-section:** A circular ring (indicating the radial node) surrounding a central solid circle.
*   **Vertical Cross-section:** Identical to horizontal (spherically symmetric).

**2. 2p Orbital ($l=1$, z-axis orientation)**
*   **Horizontal Cross-section:** Two small circles (lobes) if cutting through the lobes, or nothing/point if cutting through the node.
*   **Vertical Cross-section:** A "figure-of-eight" or two lobes stacked vertically.

**3. 2p Orbital ($l=1$, x-axis orientation)**
*   **Horizontal Cross-section:** A "figure-of-eight" or two lobes aligned horizontally.
*   **Vertical Cross-section:** A "figure-of-eight" (if viewing x-z plane) or circles (if viewing y-z plane).

**4. 2p Orbital ($l=1$, y-axis orientation)**
*   **Horizontal Cross-section:** A "figure-of-eight" aligned vertically (in the x-y plane sketch).
*   **Vertical Cross-section:** Similar to above, depending on slice.

*[**Self-Correction:** You must hand-draw these sketches or create them in a drawing tool and paste them here as images.]*

### Part (b): 3D Shape Descriptions

**1. 2s Orbital:**
Spherical shape with a spherical node inside. The electron can be found anywhere within the spherical volume except at the node (where probability is zero) and the nucleus.

**2. 2p Orbitals (x, y, z):**
Dumbbell-shaped with two lobes on opposite sides of the nucleus. The electron is found within these lobes. It cannot be found on the nodal plane that passes through the nucleus (separating the two lobes).

## Question 4: Topic 5 – Energy in Society (16 marks)

### Part (a): Net Power Radiated

**Data:**
*   Area $A = 2.6 \, \text{m}^2$
*   Temperature $T_{tank} = 65^\circ\text{C} = 338.15 \, \text{K}$
*   Temperature $T_{surr} = 19^\circ\text{C} = 292.15 \, \text{K}$
*   Emissivity $\varepsilon = 0.78$
*   Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W m}^{-2} \text{K}^{-4}$

**Calculation:**
$$ P_{net} = \varepsilon \sigma A (T_{tank}^4 - T_{surr}^4) $$
$$ P_{net} = 0.78 \times (5.67 \times 10^{-8}) \times 2.6 \times (338.15^4 - 292.15^4) $$
$$ P_{net} \approx 1.15 \times 10^{-7} \times (1.307 \times 10^{10} - 7.28 \times 10^9) $$
$$ P_{net} \approx 665.78 \, \text{W} $$

**Answer:** Net power radiated $\approx 670 \, \text{W}$ (2 s.f.).

### Part (b): Power Lost Through Insulation

**Data:**
*   Thickness $l = 95 \, \text{mm} = 0.095 \, \text{m}$
*   Thermal conductivity $k = 0.034 \, \text{W m}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1}$
*   Temperature difference $\Delta T = 65 - 19 = 46 \, \text{K}$

**Calculation:**
$$ P_{cond} = \frac{k A \Delta T}{l} $$
$$ P_{cond} = \frac{0.034 \times 2.6 \times 46}{0.095} $$
$$ P_{cond} = \frac{4.0664}{0.095} \approx 42.80 \, \text{W} $$

**Answer:** Power lost $\approx 43 \, \text{W}$ (2 s.f.).

### Part (c): Carbon Dioxide Equivalent Savings

**Calculation:**
*   Power saved = $P_{net} - P_{cond} = 665.78 - 42.80 = 622.98 \, \text{W} = 0.623 \, \text{kW}$
*   Hours in a year = $24 \times 365 = 8760 \, \text{h}$
*   Energy saved per year = $0.623 \times 8760 \approx 5457 \, \text{kWh}$
*   $\text{CO}_2\text{e}$ factor = $0.35 \, \text{kg/kWh}$

$$ \text{Total CO}_2\text{e} = 5457 \times 0.35 \approx 1910 \, \text{kg} $$

**Answer:** $\approx 1910 \, \text{kg}$ saved per year.
