# Topic 7 Part 3: Galaxies and Their Properties

## Summary

This part expands the view to the galactic scale. It introduces the classification of galaxies (Spiral, Elliptical, Irregular) using the **Hubble Tuning Fork**. It explores how galaxies rotate and introduces the concept of **Dark Matter** to explain rotational anomalies (flat rotation curves). It also touches on the large-scale structure of the Universe (clusters, cosmic web) and the mysterious **Dark Energy** driving cosmic acceleration.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| $v = \frac{2\pi a}{P}$ | Orbital Speed | Speed of an object in a circular orbit of radius $a$ and period $P$. |
| $v = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} c$ | Doppler Shift | Relates speed ($v$) to wavelength shift ($\Delta \lambda$) for light. |
| $v^2 = \frac{GM}{a}$ | Orbital Speed (Gravity) | Derived from Kepler's Laws. Suggests $v \propto 1/\sqrt{a}$ for planets. |
| $v \propto \text{constant}$ | Flat Rotation Curve | Observed in galaxies, implying mass $M$ increases with radius $a$. |

## Key Concepts

-   **Galaxy Types (Hubble Classification):**
    -   **Spiral (S/SB):** Flattened disk with spiral arms and central bulge. Can have a "bar" (SB). Contains gas/dust and young stars.
    -   **Elliptical (E0-E7):** Blobs of stars, ranging from spherical (E0) to cigar-shaped (E7). Little gas/dust, mostly old stars.
    -   **Irregular (Irr):** No distinct shape (e.g., Magellanic Clouds).

-   **Galaxy Rotation:**
    -   Measured using the **Doppler Effect** (redshift/blueshift) of light from stars.
    -   **Expected:** Speed should decrease with distance from center ($v \propto 1/\sqrt{r}$), like planets in Solar System.
    -   **Observed:** Speed stays constant (flat rotation curve) at large distances.

-   **Dark Matter:**
    -   The discrepancy in rotation curves implies huge amounts of unseen mass.
    -   **Dark Matter** interacts via gravity but NOT electromagnetism (light).
    -   It forms a "halo" around visible galaxies.
    -   It makes up ~85% of the matter in the Universe.

-   **Cosmic Composition:**
    -   **Normal Matter (Stars/Gas):** ~5%
    -   **Dark Matter:** ~27%
    -   **Dark Energy:** ~68% (causing accelerated expansion).

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Identifying Galaxy Types
**Problem:** A galaxy appears as a flat disk with spiral arms and a bright bar across the center. How is it classified?
**Solution:** **SB** (Barred Spiral). If arms are tightly wound, **SBa**; if loose, **SBc**.

### Activity 3.3: Orbital Speeds
**Problem:** Calculate the orbital speed of Earth ($a=1.5\times 10^{11}\text{ m}$, $P=3.15\times 10^7\text{ s}$).
**Solution:**
$v = \frac{2\pi a}{P} = \frac{2 \times 3.14 \times 1.5 \times 10^{11}}{3.15 \times 10^7} \approx 30,000 \text{ m s}^{-1} = 30 \text{ km s}^{-1}$.

### Question: Dark Matter Evidence
**Problem:** If a galaxy has a flat rotation curve ($v$ is constant), what does this imply about the mass $M$ inside radius $r$?
**Solution:**
If $v^2 = GM/r$ and $v$ is constant, then $M/r$ must be constant.
Therefore, $M \propto r$.
This means mass continues to increase linearly with distance, far beyond the visible edge of the galaxy, implying an invisible "halo" of Dark Matter.

## Activities

### Activity 3.1: Galaxy Shapes (The Lemon Experiment)
**Aim:** To understand projection effects in observing galaxies.
**Observation:**
-   An "Elliptical" shape could be a sphere, a flattened disk seen at an angle, or a cigar shape.
-   A single 2D image cannot uniquely determine the 3D shape of a galaxy without velocity data.

### Activity 3.2: Galaxy Classification
**Task:** Sort images into Spiral vs Elliptical.
-   **Spiral:** Features arms, dust lanes, bluish tint (young stars).
-   **Elliptical:** Smooth, yellow/reddish tint (old stars), featureless.
