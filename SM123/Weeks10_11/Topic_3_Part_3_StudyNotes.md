# Topic 3 Part 3: Ionic Interactions Between Metallic and Non-Metallic Elements

## Summary

Ionic bonding occurs when metals transfer electrons to non-metals. Metals lose electrons to form positive ions (cations), while non-metals gain electrons to form negative ions (anions). The resulting ions have noble gas electron configurations and are held together by strong electrostatic forces.

## Key Concepts

### Ions
- **Ion**: A charged particle formed when an atom loses or gains electrons
- **Cation**: Positive ion (metals lose electrons)
- **Anion**: Negative ion (non-metals gain electrons)
- Number of protons unchanged - defines element
- Charge determined by electron gain/loss

### Noble Gas Configuration
- Noble gases (Group 18) are very stable and unreactive
- Atoms form ions to achieve noble gas electron configurations
- Example: Na (2, 8, 1) → Na⁺ (2, 8) = same as Ne (2, 8)
- Example: Cl (2, 8, 7) → Cl⁻ (2, 8, 8) = same as Ar (2, 8, 8)

### Predicting Ion Charges from Periodic Table

| Group | Electrons Lost/Gained | Ion Charge | Example |
|-------|----------------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Lose 1 | +1 | Na⁺ |
| 2 | Lose 2 | +2 | Mg²⁺ |
| 16 | Gain 2 | -2 | O²⁻ |
| 17 | Gain 1 | -1 | Cl⁻ |

### Writing Ion Symbols
- Chemical symbol + superscript charge
- Number before sign: Mg²⁺, O²⁻
- +1 and -1 written as just + or -: Na⁺, Cl⁻

### Ionic Compounds
- Total positive charge = Total negative charge (neutral overall)
- Strong **electrostatic forces** (ionic bonds) hold ions together
- Form giant lattice structures

### Chemical Formulae
- Write positive ion first
- Subscript numbers show ratio
- NaCl (1:1 ratio of Na⁺ to Cl⁻)
- CaCl₂ (1:2 ratio of Ca²⁺ to Cl⁻)
- When combining different charges: total + must equal total -

### Properties of Ionic Compounds
1. **Solid at room temperature** - high melting points
2. **Regular crystal shapes** - reflect ion packing
3. **Brittle** - fracture along crystal planes
4. **Do not conduct electricity as solids** - ions fixed in position
5. **Conduct electricity when molten or dissolved** - ions free to move

### Melting Points
- Higher charge → stronger ionic bonds → higher melting point
- MgO (Mg²⁺, O²⁻) has much higher melting point than NaCl (Na⁺, Cl⁻)

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 3.1: Charge on Nitrogen Atom

What is the overall charge of a nitrogen atom (atomic mass 14, atomic number 7)?

**Solution:** **Zero** - A neutral nitrogen atom has 7 protons (+7) and 7 electrons (-7), so the overall charge is 0.

### Problem 3.2: Sodium Losing an Electron

What would happen to the charge on a sodium atom if it had one electron less?

**Solution:** The sodium atom would become a **positively charged ion (Na⁺)**.
- 11 protons = +11
- 10 electrons = -10
- Overall charge = +1

**Electron configuration of oxygen?** → **2, 6**

**Nearest noble gas?** → **Neon** (atomic number 10)

**Electron configuration of neon?** → **2, 8**

**Difference?** → **Oxygen needs 2 more electrons**

**Charge when oxygen gains 2 electrons?** → **-2 (O²⁻)**

**Which group is oxygen in?** → **Group 16**

### Problem 3.10: Calcium and Chloride

What combination of Ca²⁺ and Cl⁻ will provide a neutral compound?

**Solution:** One Ca²⁺ (+2) needs two Cl⁻ (-1 each = -2)
Formula: **CaCl₂**

---

### Problem 3.11: Why Solid Ionic Can't Conduct

Why can't an ionic solid conduct electricity?

**Solution:** In a solid ionic compound, the ions are **fixed in position** in the crystal lattice. They cannot move, so there can be no flow of charge. Electrical conduction requires charged particles that can move.

---

### Problem 3.12: Allowing Ions to Move

Suggest a way that ions in sodium chloride could be allowed to move.

**Solution:**
1. **Melt it** - heating to high temperature (801°C for NaCl) gives ions enough energy to move freely
2. **Dissolve it in water** - water molecules separate the ions, allowing them to move freely in solution

---

### Problem 3.13: Melting Point Comparison

Which has higher melting point: magnesium oxide or sodium fluoride?

**Solution:** **Magnesium oxide (MgO)** has the higher melting point.

Reason: MgO contains Mg²⁺ and O²⁻ ions (both doubly charged), while NaF contains Na⁺ and F⁻ ions (both singly charged). The electrostatic attraction between ions with higher charges is stronger, requiring more energy to overcome, hence a higher melting point.

- MgO melts at 2852°C
- NaF melts at 993°C
