# Topic 9 Part 3: The Evolving Universe

## Summary

This part outlines the timeline of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present. It describes the four **fundamental interactions** (Gravity, Electromagnetic, Weak, Strong) and how they were unified at high energies in the early Universe. It details key eras: **Inflation**, **Nucleosynthesis** (formation of H, He, Li), and **Recombination** (formation of atoms, release of CMB). It explains how the initial smooth Universe evolved structure (stars and galaxies) from tiny quantum fluctuations.

## Key Concepts

-   **Fundamental Interactions:**
    1.  **Gravity:** Infinite range, acts on mass/energy. Dominates large scales.
    2.  **Electromagnetic:** Infinite range, acts on charge. Dominates chemistry/atomic physics.
    3.  **Weak:** Short range, radioactive decay ($p \leftrightarrow n$).
    4.  **Strong:** Short range, binds quarks/nuclei.

-   **Unification:**
    -   **Electroweak:** EM + Weak unify at ~100 GeV (verified by Higgs boson).
    -   **Grand Unification (GUT):** Electroweak + Strong unify at ~$10^{15}$ GeV.
    -   **Superunification (TOE):** All four (including Gravity) unify at Planck Energy (~$10^{19}$ GeV). String Theory/M-Theory are candidates.

-   **Timeline of the Universe:**
    1.  **Planck Era ($< 10^{-43}$ s):** Physics unknown.
    2.  **Inflation:** Rapid exponential expansion. Smoothed out the Universe but stretched quantum fluctuations to cosmic scales.
    3.  **Quark Era:** Quarks/Gluons/Leptons form.
    4.  **Hadron Era ($\sim 10^{-5}$ s):** Quarks bind into Protons/Neutrons. Matter-Antimatter annihilation leaves slight matter excess.
    5.  **Nucleosynthesis (3 - 20 mins):** Protons and Neutrons fuse to form **Helium** (~25% by mass), **Deuterium**, and **Lithium**.
    6.  **Recombination (380,000 yrs):** $T \approx 3000$ K. Electrons bind to nuclei to form neutral atoms. **CMB emitted**.
    7.  **Dark Ages:** No stars yet.
    8.  **Structure Formation:** Gravity pulls matter into clumps (seeded by inflation fluctuations) to form first stars and galaxies.

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Cooling and Expansion
**Problem:** When the Universe was 1 s old, $T \approx 10^{10}$ K. What was $T$ at 100 s?
**Rule:** As age increases by 100x, Temperature drops by 10x.
**Solution:**
At 100 s ($100 \times$ older), $T = 10^{10} / 10 = 10^9$ K.

### Activity 3.1: History of the Universe
**Task:** Order the events.
1.  Formation of Quarks/Leptons.
2.  Annihilation of Quarks/Antiquarks.
3.  Formation of Protons/Neutrons.
4.  Annihilation of Electrons/Positrons.
5.  Formation of Light Nuclei (Nucleosynthesis).
6.  Formation of Atoms (Recombination/CMB).

### Question: Origin of Elements
**Source:**
-   **Helium:** Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (most of it).
-   **Oxygen:** Stellar Nucleosynthesis (in stars).
-   **Uranium:** Supernovae / Neutron Star Mergers.

## Key Themes
-   **Inflation:** Explains why the Universe is so uniform (horizon problem) and flat.
-   **Nucleosynthesis:** The predicted abundance of Helium (25%) matches observations perfectly, a major triumph of the Big Bang theory.
