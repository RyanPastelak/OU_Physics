# Topic 6 Introduction: Nuclei and Particles

## Summary

This topic introduces the physics that operates at the smallest scales of the Universe – nuclear physics and particle physics. Several concepts from earlier topics (atoms, energy) are revisited as you explore nuclear and particle reactions, and the fundamental interactions governing their behaviour. These concepts will feature again in the final topic concerning the origin and early history of the Universe.

**Topic Structure:**
- **Part 1**: Atoms and energy revisited (1.5 hours)
- **Part 2**: Nuclear physics (6.5 hours)
- **Part 3**: Particle physics (5 hours)
