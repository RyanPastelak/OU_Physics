# Topic 1 Part 2: Forces and Motion

## Summary

This part explores the forces associated with motion, using the example of a braking cyclist. The key focus is on **friction** - the force that opposes motion between surfaces. Two main contributions to friction are surface roughness (on microscopic scales) and chemical interactions between close surfaces.

**Key topics covered:**
- **Friction**: The force that opposes motion, dependent on surface properties and normal reaction force
- **Resolving Forces**: Breaking diagonal forces into horizontal and vertical components using trigonometry
- **Newton's Second Law**: Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma)
- **Acceleration**: The rate of change of speed or direction
- **Newton's Third Law**: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
- **Forces on Flying Objects**: Lift, thrust, weight, and air resistance

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| F_fric = μN | Maximum Frictional Force | Friction equals coefficient of friction times normal reaction force |
| a = (v - u) / t | Acceleration | Change in speed divided by time |
| F = ma | Newton's Second Law | Force equals mass times acceleration |
| a = F / m | Acceleration (rearranged) | Acceleration equals force divided by mass |
| N = mg cos(θ) | Normal Reaction on Incline | Component of weight perpendicular to inclined surface |
| μN = mg sin(θ) | Friction on Incline | Component of weight parallel to inclined surface (at slip point) |
| μ = tan(θ) | Coefficient of Friction | From inclined plane experiment at slip angle |
| F_x = F cos(θ) | Horizontal Component | Force component adjacent to angle |
| F_y = F sin(θ) | Vertical Component | Force component opposite to angle |

## Key Concepts

- **Friction**: Opposes motion; grows to match applied force until maximum value is reached, then object moves

- **Coefficient of Friction (μ)**: Dimensionless number describing how "grippy" two surfaces are together (e.g., tyre on ice ≈ 0.01, tyre on tarmac ≈ 1)

- **Normal Reaction Force (N)**: The larger this force, the larger the maximum friction

- **Resolving Forces**: Breaking a force into perpendicular components using trigonometry
  - Horizontal component = F × cos(θ)
  - Vertical component = F × sin(θ)

- **Trigonometry Basics**:
  - sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse
  - cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse
  - tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent

- **Acceleration**: Change in speed or direction; units are m s⁻²
  - Positive acceleration = speeding up
  - Negative acceleration (deceleration) = slowing down

- **Newton's Second Law**: F = ma - enables prediction of motion from forces

- **Newton's Third Law**: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction (e.g., astronauts pushing off each other)

- **Forces on Flying Objects**:
  - **Lift**: Upward force from air moving faster over wing top
  - **Thrust**: Forward force from pushing air backward
  - **Weight**: Downward gravitational force
  - **Air Resistance (Drag)**: Backward force opposing motion

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 2.2: Frictional Force on Sledge

If the applied force on the sledge, F, is 100 N directed to the right, determine the frictional force if the sledge remains at rest.

- (a) 100 N to the left
- (b) 50 N to the left
- (c) 200 N to the left
- (d) 150 N to the left

**Solution:** Since the sledge remains at rest, the forces must be balanced. The frictional force must equal the applied force but act in the opposite direction.

Frictional force = **100 N to the left** (Answer: a)

---

### Problem 2.3: Force to Start Moving

With μ = 0.500, m = 100 kg, and g = 9.81 m s⁻², calculate the force at which the sledge starts moving.

**Solution:**
- Normal reaction force N = mg = 100 kg × 9.81 m s⁻² = 981 N
- Maximum friction force F_fric = μN = 0.500 × 981 N = 490.5 N
- The applied force must exceed this to start moving
- Force = **491 N** (to 3 significant figures)

**Solution:**
a = (v - u) / t = (0 - 10) / 2 = -10 / 2 = **−5 m s⁻²** (Answer: a)

The negative sign indicates deceleration (slowing down).

**Solution:** N_rear = ½ × W = ½ × 981 N = **491 N upwards** (Answer: b)

(The normal reaction force acts upwards from the ground)

---

**Step 3: Calculate friction force**

**Solution:**
F_fric = μN = 0.800 × 491 N = 392.8 N ≈ **393 N**

Direction: **opposite to motion** (against the direction of travel)

**Step 4: Calculate acceleration**

Options:
- (a) 9.81 m s⁻² downwards
- (b) 5 m s⁻¹ against the motion

- (d) 3.92 m s⁻² against the motion

**Solution:**
a = F / m = 392.8 N / 100 kg = **3.92 m s⁻² against the motion** (Answer: d)

**Verification from video:** In the video, the cyclist slows from 4.5 m s⁻¹ to 0 in 1.1 s.
a = (0 - 4.5) / 1.1 = -4.1 m s⁻² (close to our calculated value!)

Options:
- (a) 14 N upwards
- (b) 140 N upwards
- (c) 9.8 N downwards
- (d) 1.4 N downwards

**Solution:**
At constant height, lift must balance weight.
Lift = Weight = mg = 14 kg × 9.81 m s⁻² = 137.3 N ≈ **140 N upwards** (Answer: b)

---

### Problem 2.11: Thrust Balance

If the swan is moving with constant speed, which force must be balanced by the thrust of the wings?

**Solution:** At constant speed, thrust must balance **air resistance (drag)**.

If thrust > drag: swan accelerates
If thrust < drag: swan decelerates
If thrust = drag: constant speed

## Activities

### Activity 2.1 Exploring frictional forces

Allow approximately 15 minutes

Use the interactive model to explore frictional forces by adjusting mass (m), coefficient of friction (μ), and applied force (F).

**Question 1: Identify forces**
- Arrow mg represents the **weight**
- Arrow F represents the **applied force**
- Arrow N represents the **normal reaction force**

**Question 2: Normal reaction vs weight relationship**
**Solution:** The magnitude of the normal reaction force equals the weight of the sledge (for a horizontal surface). N = mg.

**Question 3: Frictional force when F = 100 N**
**Solution:** If the sledge remains at rest, friction = 100 N to the left (balances applied force).

**Question 4: Force to start moving (μ = 0.500, m = 100 kg)**
**Solution:** F = μmg = 0.500 × 100 × 9.81 = 490.5 N ≈ **491 N**

### Activity 2.2 Measuring the coefficient of friction

Allow approximately 1 hour

**Aim:** Determine the coefficient of friction for a surface.

**Equipment:**
- Chopping board (or flat rigid surface)
- Small can of food (e.g., 250 g beans)
- Protractor
- Lab notebook

**Method:**
1. Place can on chopping board near one edge
2. Gradually raise the far edge until can starts to slide
3. Measure angle θ at which sliding begins (expect 20-30° for wood/plastic)
4. Repeat several times and calculate average

**Analysis:**

Forces at slip point:
- Normal reaction: N = mg cos(θ) (perpendicular to board)
- Friction: F_fric = mg sin(θ) (parallel to board, up the slope)
- Weight: mg (vertically downward)

At maximum static friction:
μN = mg sin(θ)
μ × mg cos(θ) = mg sin(θ)
μ = sin(θ) / cos(θ)
**μ = tan(θ)**

**Example:** If θ = 25°, then μ = tan(25°) = 0.47
