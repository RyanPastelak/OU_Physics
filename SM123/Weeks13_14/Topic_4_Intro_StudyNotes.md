# Topic 4 Introduction: The Quantum Realm

## Summary

When structures are smaller than ~100 nm (about 1000 times thinner than a human hair), Newton's laws fail. A completely different theory is needed: **quantum mechanics**. This is one of the strangest yet most thoroughly tested theories in physics.

**Three main features of quantum mechanics:**

1. **Wave-particle duality**: Objects can exhibit both wave-like AND particle-like behaviours
2. **Quantisation**: Objects can only have fixed amounts of energy called **quanta**
3. **Probabilistic behaviour**: The laws of chance govern the behaviour of objects
