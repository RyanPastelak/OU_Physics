# Topic 4 Review: The Quantum Realm

## Summary - Key Points

1. **Wave-particle duality**: Tiny objects (electrons, photons) have both wave-like and particle-like properties
   - Wave ideas for movement
   - Particle ideas for interaction with matter

2. **Indeterminacy**: Cannot predict exact outcome, only probabilities of possible outcomes

3. **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**: Cannot measure both position AND velocity with arbitrary precision

4. **Discrete spectrum of hydrogen**: Explained by electron standing waves (Schrödinger model)

5. **Four quantum numbers describe hydrogen states**:
   - n (principal): 1, 2, 3, ...
   - l (orbital): 0 to (n-1)
   - mₗ (magnetic): -l to +l
   - mₛ (spin): +½ or -½

6. **Energy levels** of hydrogen and single-electron ions:
   **E_n = -13.6 × Z² / n² eV**

7. **Pauli exclusion principle**: No two electrons can have the same quantum state → max 2 electrons per orbital

8. **Madelung rule**: Orbitals fill in order of (n + l), then by n → structure of Periodic Table
