# Topic 8 Part 1: Pluto, the Kuiper Belt and Comets

## Summary

This part focuses on the outer Solar System. It explains the formation of the Solar System from the Solar Nebula and the significance of the **Snow Line**. It details the discovery and reclassification of **Pluto** as a dwarf planet and a member of the **Kuiper Belt**. The nature of **comets**—their composition, orbits, and relationship to the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud—is also explored, highlighted by findings from the Rosetta and New Horizons missions.

## Key Concepts

-   **Solar System Formation:**
    -   **Solar Nebula:** Rotating cloud of gas and dust.
    -   **Differentiation:** Inner planets (rock/metal) vs. Outer planets (gas/ice) determined by the **Snow Line** (distance where water freezes).
    -   **Nice Model:** Giant planets migrated (Jupiter inward, Neptune outward), scattering planetesimals to form the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud.

-   **Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs):**
    -   **Plutinos:** Objects in 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune (including Pluto). They orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits.
    -   **Classical KBOs:** Low eccentricity orbits, not in resonance.
    -   **Scattered Disc Objects:** High eccentricity, scattered by Neptune.
    -   **Pluto:** Reclassified as a **dwarf planet** in 2006 because it has not "cleared its orbit". Features complex geology (nitrogen ice plains, water ice mountains).

-   **Comets:**
    -   **Nucleus:** "Dirty snowball" of ice (water, CO2, ammonia) and dust. Very low density (~530 kg/m³).
    -   **Coma & Tail:** Form when approaching the Sun; ices sublime, releasing dust and gas.
    -   **Short-period (<200 years):** From Kuiper Belt.
    -   **Long-period:** From Oort Cloud.

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Orbital Resonance
**Problem:** Pluto has a semi-major axis $a_P = 39.4$ AU. Neptune has $a_N = 30.0$ AU. Confirm the 3:2 resonance.
**Solution:**
Using Kepler's Third Law ($P^2 = a^3$):
$P_P = \sqrt{39.4^3} \approx 247$ years.
$P_N = \sqrt{30.0^3} \approx 164$ years.
Ratio $P_P / P_N = 247 / 164 \approx 1.5 = 3/2$.
Thus, Pluto completes 2 orbits in the time Neptune completes 3.

### Activity 1.1: Cometary Dust
**Aim:** Relate crater size on impact foils to dust grain size.
**Key Relationship:** $D_{crater} \propto D_{particle}$.
**Method:** Measured crater diameters on aluminum foil hit by particles. Used calibration graph to estimate particle size.
**Result:** Determining particle sizes helps analyze the size distribution of dust in a comet's coma.

## Activities

### Activity: Classifying KBOs
-   **Ultima Thule (Arrokoth):** Eccentricity 0.04, $a=44.6$ AU. **Classical KBO** (Cold population).
-   **Pluto:** Eccentricity 0.25, $a=39.4$ AU. **Plutino** (Resonant).
