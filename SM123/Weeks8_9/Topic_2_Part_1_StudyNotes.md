# Topic 2 Part 1: The Energy Account

## Summary

Energy is an accounting tool - a quantity associated with specific properties of a system (like temperature, motion, compression). The power of energy comes from **conservation**: if one entry increases, another must decrease to compensate. The energy "balance sheet" always balances.

**Key topics:**
- Energy units: joules (J) and kilowatt hours (kWh)
- Power: the rate of energy use (watts, W)
- Conservation of energy
- Energy consumption measurement

## Key Equations

| Equation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J = 3.6 MJ | Energy unit conversion |
| 1 W = 1 J s⁻¹ | Power definition |
| Energy = Power × Time | Energy from power rating |

## Key Concepts

- **Energy Unit (kWh)**: The amount of energy a 1 kW device uses in 1 hour
- **Joule (J)**: SI unit of energy; 1 J = 1 kg m² s⁻²
- **Power (W)**: Rate of energy use; watts = joules per second
- **Conservation of Energy**: Energy can never be created or destroyed - only transferred
- **Perpetual Motion Machines**: Impossible because friction always converts some energy to heat

**Energy is NOT a substance** - it's a way of accounting for properties like:
- Temperature (thermal energy)
- Motion (kinetic energy)
- Position in a force field (potential energy)
- Compression

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1.1: Washing Machine Energy

If the washing machine had to heat 150 litres of water from 20°C to 40°C instead of 100 litres, would the 'incoming' energy:
- decrease
- stay the same
- increase

**Solution:** The incoming energy must **increase**.

The energy account must always balance (conservation of energy). If more water needs to be heated, more energy is consumed in the 'outgoings' column, so more energy must be supplied in the 'incoming' column.

### Problem 1.2: Tea-Making Simplifications

What simplifications were made in the energy account for making a cup of tea?

**Solution:** Several simplifications were made:
- The energy losses to the surroundings during boiling were ignored
- The heat capacity of the cup was simplified
- The energy lost as steam was not explicitly accounted for
- The cooling rate was assumed uniform
- The exact mechanisms (evaporation, conduction, convection) were not detailed

### Problem 1.3: Kettle Measurement Discrepancy

Compare your measured power with the manufacturer's rating. Why might there be a discrepancy?

**Solution:** Possible reasons for discrepancy:
- **Background consumption**: Other appliances running that weren't fully accounted for
- **Voltage fluctuations**: Mains voltage varies slightly from the standard 230/240V
- **Age and condition**: The heating element may be less efficient than when new
- **Measurement timing**: Starting/stopping the count may not perfectly align with appliance operation
- **Power rating accuracy**: Manufacturer ratings are often approximate
- **Standby power**: Some appliances draw power even when "off"

### Problem 1.4: Glucose Molecules for Climbing Stairs

Using appropriate values from the data table, calculate how many molecules of glucose are required by a 60 kg person climbing a 3 m flight of stairs, assuming all energy from glucose oxidation raises gravitational potential energy.

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Calculate gravitational potential energy gained
- E_g = mgh = 60 kg × 9.81 m s⁻² × 3 m = **1765.8 J** ≈ 1.77 kJ

**Step 2:** Energy from one glucose molecule oxidation
- From data table: Energy per glucose molecule = 7.6 × 10⁻¹⁸ J

**Step 3:** Calculate number of molecules
- Number = Total energy / Energy per molecule
- Number = 1765.8 J / (7.6 × 10⁻¹⁸ J)
- Number = **2.3 × 10²⁰ molecules**

### Problem 1.5: Glucose Molecules with Heat Loss

Since only 24% of glucose energy produces motion (76% becomes heat), re-estimate how many glucose molecules are needed.

**Solution:**

If only 24% of the energy goes to mechanical work, we need more glucose molecules.

**Step 1:** Energy needed (accounting for 24% efficiency)
- Useful energy needed = 1765.8 J
- Total energy from glucose = 1765.8 J / 0.24 = **7357.5 J**

**Step 2:** Calculate number of molecules
- Number = 7357.5 J / (7.6 × 10⁻¹⁸ J)
- Number = **9.7 × 10²⁰ molecules**

This is about **4× more** than the previous estimate because most energy is "lost" as heat.

### Worked Example 1.2: Wind Turbines and Boiling Water

How many litres of water can be brought to boiling point (from 20°C) in 1 day using the entire capacity of German wind turbines?

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Energy output of German wind turbines per day
- From data table: 1.5 × 10¹⁴ J per day (approximately)

**Step 2:** Energy to heat 1 litre of water from 20°C to 100°C
- Temperature change = 80°C = 80 K
- Energy = mass × specific heat × ΔT
- For 1 kg (1 litre) of water: E = 1 kg × 4186 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹ × 80 K = **3.35 × 10⁵ J**

**Step 3:** Calculate number of litres
- Litres = (1.5 × 10¹⁴ J) / (3.35 × 10⁵ J per litre)
- Litres = **4.5 × 10⁸ litres** (450 million litres!)

## Activities

### Activity 1.1 Energy consumption in a typical home

Allow approximately 15 minutes

Think about electrical appliances in a typical home and categorize their energy use:

| Appliance | Heat | Light | Sound | Motion | Computing | Other |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|

| Computer | yes | yes | yes | | yes | |
| Kettle | yes | | | | | |
| TV | yes | yes | yes | | | |
| Vacuum cleaner | yes | | yes | yes | | |
| Light bulb | yes | yes | | | | |
| Fridge | yes | | yes | yes | | cooling |

### Activity 1.2 Estimating the energy usage of appliances

Allow approximately 15 minutes

Find power ratings (in W) for three electrical appliances. Calculate total energy consumption.

**Example calculations:**
- 2.2 kW kettle for 3 minutes: E = 2200 W × 180 s = 396,000 J = 396 kJ = 0.11 kWh
- 300 W computer for 2 hours: E = 300 W × 7200 s = 2,160,000 J = 2.16 MJ = 0.6 kWh
- 60 W light bulb for 5 hours: E = 60 W × 18000 s = 1,080,000 J = 1.08 MJ = 0.3 kWh

---

### Activity 1.3 Measuring the energy consumption of an appliance

Allow approximately 1 hour

**Meter Types:**
- **Electronic meter (800 imp/kWh)**: each flash = 0.00125 kWh = 4500 J
- **Electronic meter (1000 imp/kWh)**: each flash = 0.001 kWh = 3600 J
- **Dial meter**: each rotation = 0.004 kWh = 14,400 J

**Worked Example (Kettle with 1000 imp/kWh meter):**
- Observed 31 flashes in 41 seconds
- Energy = 31 × 0.001 kWh = 0.031 kWh = 111,600 J
- Power = 111,600 J / 41 s = **2722 W** (before subtracting background)
- If background = 70 W, then kettle power = 2722 - 70 = **2652 W** ≈ 2.7 kW
