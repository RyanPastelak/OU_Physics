# Topic 8 Part 3: Mars

## Summary

This part explores the Red Planet, focusing on its geology, hydrology, and potential for life. It discusses Martian landforms (volcanoes like Olympus Mons, canyons like Valles Marineris) and the overwhelming evidence for **past water** (river channels, lake bed sediments, hydrated minerals). It also covers **Martian meteorites** as a unique sample source and evaluates the current search for **life** (past or present).

## Key Concepts

-   **Martian Geology:**
    -   **Hemispheric Dichotomy:** Northern lowlands (younger, smoother) vs. Southern highlands (older, heavily cratered).
    -   **Volcanism:** Massive shield volcanoes (Tharsis region) active in the past.
    -   **Sedimentary Rocks:** Found by rovers (Curiosity), showing layers formed in standing water (lakes) and cross-bedding from flowing streams.

-   **Water on Mars:**
    -   **Past:** Warm and wet (Noachian epoch). Evidence: Valley networks, delta deposits (Jezero Crater), clay minerals.
    -   **Present:** Cold and dry. Water exists as **ice** (polar caps, subsurface) and potentially hydrated minerals. Liquid water is unstable on the surface today due to low pressure.

-   **Martian Meteorites:**
    -   Igneous rocks (Shergottites, Nakhlites, Chassignites) ejected from Mars by impacts.
    -   Identified by trapped gas bubbles matching Mars' atmosphere.
    -   Younger ages (e.g., 165 Ma - 1.3 Ga) prove Mars was volcanically active recently (compared to asteroids).
    -   **ALH84001:** Controversy over potential "microfossils".

-   **Life on Mars:**
    -   **Surface:** Hostile (UV radiation, oxidising perchlorates).
    -   **Subsurface:** Potential refuges for microbial life (endoliths) protected from radiation, possibly using chemical energy (chemosynthesis).

## Problems and Solutions

### Activity 3.1: Interpreting Martian Landscapes
**Task:** Analyze an image of a channel on the Hellas Basin rim.
1.  **Sun Direction:** Shadows in craters indicate illumination direction.
2.  **Formation:** Meandering channel implies flowing liquid (water).
3.  **Relative Ages:** Channel cuts through some craters (younger than them) but has craters inside it (older than those).
4.  **Crater Counting:** Used to estimate the age of the surface. More craters = Older surface.
    -   **Calculation:** Crater density $\times$ Area $\to$ Age estimate.

### Question: Is there life on Mars?
**Current Status:**
-   No direct evidence of living organisms found yet.
-   Methane plumes detected (Curiosity/orbiters) could be biological or geological.
-   Organic molecules found in mudstones (Curiosity).
-   Future missions (ExoMars, Mars 2020) target signs of *past* life.

## Activities

-   **Crater Counting:** A fundamental technique in planetary science.
    -   **Principle:** The older a surface, the longer it has been exposed to bombardment, so the more craters it has.
    -   **Assumptions:** Impact rate is constant (after LHB); craters are not erased by erosion/tectonics.
