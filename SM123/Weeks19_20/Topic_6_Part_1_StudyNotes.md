# Topic 6 Part 1: Atoms and Energy Revisited

## Summary

This part revisits atomic structure and explores the profound relationship between energy and mass described by Einstein's famous equation. It introduces the processes of matter-antimatter annihilation and pair production, and the energy-time uncertainty principle which allows particles to be spontaneously created from nothing for brief intervals.

**Key topics covered:**
- Atomic structure: protons, neutrons, electrons, atomic number, mass number
- Isotopes and nuclides
- Einstein's mass-energy equivalence: E = mc²
- Matter-antimatter annihilation and pair production
- Energy-time uncertainty principle

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| E = mc² | Mass-Energy Equivalence (Eqn 1.1) | Mass (m) and energy (E) are interchangeable; c = 3.00 × 10⁸ m s⁻¹ |
| matter + antimatter → 2γ | Annihilation (Eqn 1.2a) | Particle-antiparticle pair produces photons |
| 2γ → matter + antimatter | Pair Production (Eqn 1.2b) | High-energy photons create particle-antiparticle pair |
| ΔE × Δt ≥ h | Energy-Time Uncertainty (Eqn 1.3) | h = 4.14 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV s |

## Key Concepts

### Atomic Structure
- **Nucleus**: Central part containing protons (+) and neutrons (neutral)
- **Electrons**: Negatively charged particles surrounding nucleus
- **Atomic Number (Z)**: Number of protons (defines element)
- **Mass Number (A)**: Number of protons + neutrons (nucleons)
- **Isotopes**: Same element with different mass numbers (different neutron count)
- **Nuclide**: Nucleus of a particular isotope
- **Nucleons**: Collective term for protons and neutrons

### Notation
- Isotope notation: ᴬ_Z X (e.g., ¹H for hydrogen, ²H for deuterium, ⁴He for helium-4)

### Mass Energy
- Mass of electron: ~510 keV/c² (or ~9.1 × 10⁻³¹ kg)
- Mass of proton/neutron: ~940 MeV/c²
- A proton is almost 2000 times more massive than an electron

### Energy Units
- 1 eV = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ J
- 1 keV = 10³ eV
- 1 MeV = 10⁶ eV

### Antimatter
- Every particle has an antimatter counterpart with same mass but opposite properties (e.g., charge)
- Positron: antielectron (discovered 1932)
- Antihydrogen: antiprotons bound to positrons (created 1996)

### Pair Production and Annihilation
- **Annihilation**: When matter meets antimatter, both are destroyed, producing photons
- **Pair Production**: High-energy photons can create particle-antiparticle pairs
- Minimum photon energy = combined mass energy of particle and antiparticle

### Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle
- Particle-antiparticle pairs can be spontaneously created from "nothing" by "borrowing" energy for a brief time
- The energy deficit × time interval must satisfy: ΔE × Δt ≥ h

## Problems and Activities

### Activity 1.1 Mass Numbers

(a) What is the mass number of normal hydrogen?
(b) What is the mass number of 'heavy' hydrogen (deuterium)?
(c) What is the mass number of normal helium?
(d) What is the mass number of 'light' helium?

**Solution to Activity 1.1**

(a) Normal hydrogen has one proton and no neutrons, so A = 1
(b) Deuterium has one proton and one neutron, so A = 2
(c) Normal helium has two protons and two neutrons, so A = 4
(d) Light helium has two protons and one neutron, so A = 3

### Activity 1.2 Pair Production Energy

What is the minimum energy of photons needed to create an electron–positron pair?

**Solution to Activity 1.2**

The minimum energy equals the combined mass energy of electron and positron.
Each has mass energy of ~510 keV, so minimum photon energy = 2 × 510 keV = 1020 keV ≈ 1 MeV.

### Activity 1.3 Annihilation Energy

If a stationary proton and antiproton mutually annihilate each other, what amount of energy is liberated as photons?

**Solution to Activity 1.3**

Energy liberated = combined mass energy = 2 × 940 MeV = 1880 MeV ≈ 1.9 GeV.

### Activity 1.4 Spontaneous Pair Creation

An electron has a mass energy of 510 keV. For how long can an electron–positron pair exist if it is spontaneously created out of nothing?

**Solution to Activity 1.4**

Energy needed: ΔE = 2 × 510 keV = 1020 keV = 1.02 × 10⁶ eV
Using ΔE × Δt ≥ h:
Δt = h / ΔE = (4.14 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV s) / (1.02 × 10⁶ eV) ≈ 4 × 10⁻²¹ s

The pair can exist for approximately 4 × 10⁻²¹ seconds.
