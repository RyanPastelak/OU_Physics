## Topic 1 Quiz - Questions and Solutions

### Question 1: Spring Compression

A set of kitchen scales contains a spring. If the compression of the spring is 1 mm when a can of mass 0.5 kg is placed on the scales, which of the following represents the compression when two cans with combined mass 1 kg are placed on the scales?

Options:
- (a) 3 mm
- (b) 1.5 mm
- (c) 1 mm
- (d) 2 mm

**Solution:**
Using Hooke's Law: F = kx, so x = F/k = mg/k

For 0.5 kg: x₁ = (0.5 × g)/k = 1 mm
For 1 kg: x₂ = (1 × g)/k = 2 × x₁ = **2 mm** (Answer: d)

The compression is proportional to the mass (and weight).

### Question 2: Newton's Laws

Complete the statements:
(a) An object remains at rest, or moves in a ___ line at ___ speed, unless it is acted on by ___ force.
(b) Every action has an ___ and ___ reaction.

**Solution:**
(a) An object remains at rest, or moves in a **straight** line at **constant** speed, unless it is acted on by **an unbalanced** force. (Newton's First Law)

(b) Every action has an **equal** and **opposite** reaction. (Newton's Third Law)

### Question 3: Truck Acceleration

Calculate the acceleration when a truck of mass 10,000 kg is pushed by a force of 5000 N.

Options:
- (a) 0.5 m s⁻²
- (b) 2 m s⁻²
- (c) 5 × 10⁷ m s⁻²
- (d) 5 × 10³ m s⁻²

**Solution:**
Using Newton's Second Law: a = F/m

a = 5000 N / 10,000 kg = **0.5 m s⁻²** (Answer: a)

---

### Question 4: Hooke's Law Equations

Select all equations that correctly relate extension x, spring constant k_s, and applied force F_str.

**Solution:**
The correct equations are derived from Hooke's Law: F_str = k_s × x

Valid rearrangements:
- F_str = k_s × x ✓
- x = F_str / k_s ✓
- k_s = F_str / x ✓

Invalid forms would include equations with incorrect operations (e.g., division/multiplication swapped).

### Question 5: Dog's Weight

A dog has a mass of 10 kg. Calculate the weight of the dog.

Options:
- (a) 98.1 N
- (b) 10 N
- (c) 1.02 N
- (d) 9.81 N

**Solution:**
W = mg = 10 kg × 9.81 m s⁻² = **98.1 N** (Answer: a)

### Question 6: Coulomb's Law - Doubling Charges

Two identical charged objects of charge Q, separated by distance r, repel each other with a force of 10 N. If both charges are changed to 2Q (distance unchanged), calculate the new force.

Options:
- (a) 20 N
- (b) 5 N
- (c) 40 N
- (d) 2.5 N

**Solution:**
From Coulomb's Law: F ∝ Q₁ × Q₂

Original: F₁ = k × Q × Q / r² = k × Q² / r² = 10 N

New: F₂ = k × (2Q) × (2Q) / r² = k × 4Q² / r² = 4 × F₁ = **40 N** (Answer: c)

When both charges double, force increases by factor of 4.

### Question 7: Object with No Force

A moving object does not experience any force. Which graph best represents its speed?

Options:
- A: Graph of constant speed
- B: Graph of speed decreasing to zero
- C: Graph of speed increasing

**Solution:**
By Newton's First Law, an object with no net force maintains constant speed.

**Answer: A - Graph of constant speed**

### Question 8: Maximum Friction Force

A rubber block of weight 200 N sits on horizontal concrete. The coefficient of friction is μ = 0.90. Calculate the maximum horizontal force that can be applied before the block moves.

Options:
- (a) 200 N
- (b) 180 N
- (c) 222 N
- (d) 0.90 N

**Solution:**
For horizontal surface: N = W = 200 N

Maximum friction: F_fric = μN = 0.90 × 200 N = **180 N** (Answer: b)

The applied force must exceed 180 N to make the block move.

- (c) 25 N
- (d) 50 N

**Solution:**
F = Qε = 2 C × 25 N C⁻¹ = **50 N** (Answer: d)
