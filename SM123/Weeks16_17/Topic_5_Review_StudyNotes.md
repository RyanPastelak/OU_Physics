# Topic 5 Review: Energy in Society

## Summary

- Human energy usage: 5.7 × 10²⁰ J per year
- Fossil fuels supply majority of demand but always produce CO₂
- Domestic heating + transport = ~65% of energy demand
- Understanding dissipative forces is key to transport efficiency

## Quiz Questions

### Question 1
Energy is sometimes said to be a resource. Is energy used up?

---

### Question 2
According to Figure 1.1, what fraction of human energy demand is supplied by fossil fuels?

---

### Question 3
Can fossil fuels be burned without producing carbon dioxide?

---

### Question 4
Why would we generally not use a fuel with an EROI of less than 1?

---

### Question 5
What is the mathematical relationship between the rate of energy transferred through a surface (power) and the temperature difference across that surface?

---

### Question 6
Air has lower thermal conductivity than rock wool. So why does modern cavity wall insulation fill the space between brick walls with materials such as rock wool?

---

### Question 7
If the power radiated by a hot body is P = AεσT⁴, what's wrong with this calculation for a human being (not including power radiated to the human by surroundings)?

---

### Question 8
If the speed of a car is doubled, by how much does the power dissipated by air resistance change? What about rolling resistance?

---

### Question 9
When a car brakes to a standstill, which part of its energy is dissipated?
(a) potential energy
(b) kinetic energy
(c) heat

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fossil fuels** release energy via C=O bond formation → CO₂ is unavoidable
2. **Nuclear fuels** have enormous specific energy (E = mc²)
3. **EROI** measures value of fuel source (higher = better)
4. **Heat conduction**: P = -kAΔT/l
5. **Cavity walls** effective because air has low thermal conductivity
6. **Convection** must be prevented in insulation (use wool/foam)
7. **Thermal radiation**: P = AεσT⁴
8. **Rolling resistance power** ∝ speed
9. **Air resistance power** ∝ speed³ (most important at high speeds)
10. **Braking** dissipates kinetic energy (significant in city driving)
