# Topic 2 Introduction: An Introduction to Energy

## Summary

This topic explores energy through three big ideas:

1. **Energy Conservation**: Energy is an accounting tool - the total energy always remains the same. You cannot increase energy somewhere without decreasing it elsewhere by the same amount. The "energy books" always balance.

2. **Types of Energy**: All energy is either:
   - **Kinetic energy** - energy associated with motion
   - **Potential energy** - energy associated with the presence of a force
   - Total energy = Kinetic energy + Potential energy

3. **Energy Transfer**: Energy moves between accounts via:
   - **Work** - energy transfer through forces acting
   - **Heat** - energy transfer due to temperature differences

## Key Concepts

- **Energy Conservation**: The "books" always balance - energy gains in one part of a system are balanced by decreases elsewhere
- **Kinetic Energy**: Energy of motion
- **Potential Energy**: Energy of position/arrangement in a force field
- **Work**: Energy transfer when forces act
- **Heat**: Energy transfer due to temperature differences

## Study Plan

| Part | Content | Time (hours) |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Part 1 | The energy account | 5 |
| Part 2 | Kinetic and potential energy | 6.5 |
