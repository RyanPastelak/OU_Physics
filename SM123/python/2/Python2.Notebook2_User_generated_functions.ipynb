    "Python provides many built-in functions for performing calculations and operations on data. In addition, there are many external modules and packages that contain a large number of functions. This is one of the characteristics that makes Python so useful: there’s probably a pre-existing function out there that will do whatever you have in mind. Note that the built-in functions appear in a different colour in the code cells (in green in these Notebooks). You should not use names of built-in functions for variables or functions you create yourself as this will normally cause the program to fail.\n",

Later on, you will be asked to write a program that calculates the energy difference between two states. While writing this program, it would be very useful if there was a function available that could calculate the energy of a state. The program below does this for hydrogen."

    "In the program, a function named `energy` is defined. The function block starts with the line `def energy(n):` and ends with the `return ener` statement. The function takes a single input variable `n` and returns the value of the energy contained in the variable `ener`. Similarly to the selection (`if`) and iteration statements (`for` or `while`), the indentation is important here. Note also that the line `return ener` indicates the variable to be returned when the function is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define  a custom function using `def`, we are telling the code what to do in the future when we call that function. We are saying “When I call this function, I want you do this to the data I pass you”. Defining a function does not cause anything to happen, not until you use the function you’ve created.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when the print statement calls `energy(n)`, the program jumps to the definition of the function and executes all the instructions contained within (i.e. everything that is indented). When it reaches the `return ener` statement, it jumps back to the line that called the function (e.g. the `print` statement) and then continues executing the rest of the instructions in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the name of the variable within the user defined function does not have to be the same as the name of the variable outside the function. Here, a variable `n` is defined in line 14 and passed to the function in line 16. The function uses the same name for that variable (`n`) in lines 7 and 10. You could, if you wish, use a different variable name (say `m`) within the function at lines 7 and 10. Try changing the program yourself to see this. This feature can be useful if you call the same function multiple times within the same program, but using a different variable each time. (If you don't want to count the lines in a code cell, you can have them displayed by either clicking on the cell and then typing <code>Shift</code>+L or by clicking on the cell and then clicking on 'View' at the top of the Notebook and then choosing 'Show Line Numbers' from the menu that appears.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can also take more than one variable as input. These are called **arguments** and they are written to the right of the function (inside the brackets) separated by commas. Remember the colon at the end of the line: the program won’t work if you forget it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing to note in the program is that I defined the variable `ryd_constant` to contain the value of the Rydberg constant *inside* the function. This means that I can't use the variable outside the function. However, if I had defined `ryd_constant` outside the function, I would have been able to use it anywhere. (You can test this by adding a print statement that prints the value of the Rydberg constant outside the function block and then defining it either inside or outside the function. One of these will give you an error message.)\n"
