# Topic 5 Part 1: Energy Resources

## Summary

Human energy consumption is vast: ~5.7 × 10²⁰ J per year globally. Energy is conserved, but it dissipates as heat through random molecular motion, which cannot be recovered. This is why we "consume" fuel - we're transferring useful energy into unusable thermal energy.

## Key Concepts

### Scale of Energy Consumption
- **World consumption (2015)**: 13,647 Mtoe = 5.7140 × 10²⁰ J
- **Per capita (World)**: 1.8 toe/year
- **Per capita (UK)**: 2 toe/year
- **Per capita (USA)**: 7 toe/year
- **1 toe** = 41.9 GJ (energy from burning 1 tonne of crude oil)

### Energy Dissipation
- Energy is **conserved** but gets converted to random thermal motion
- This thermal energy cannot be recovered for useful work
- All processes involve agitation of random molecular motion
- Temperature relates to kinetic energy of molecular motion

### Efficiency

**Efficiency = W / E_sup = Work output / Energy supplied**

| Engine Type | Efficiency |
|-------------|------------|
| Steam locomotive | 6-9% |
| Steam turbine | 30-40% |
| Diesel engine | 40-48% |
| Petrol engine | 20-32% |
| Electric motor | >90% |

### Specific Energy
Energy released per kilogram of fuel (MJ kg⁻¹):

| Fuel | Specific Energy (MJ kg⁻¹) |
|------|---------------------------|
| Coal | 10-35 |
| Oil | 41-48 |
| Gas | 53-55 |
| Methane | 55.5 |
| Fats | 37 |
| Carbohydrates | 17 |
| Alkaline battery | 0.5 |
| **Uranium** | **8.06 × 10⁷** |

### Fossil Fuels
- Originated 300-360 million years ago (Carboniferous period)
- Originally solar energy captured by photosynthesis
- Carbon content determines energy value

**Burning coal produces:**
- CO₂ (greenhouse gas - contributes to climate change)
- H₂O
- NOₓ (pollutants - acid rain, health hazards)
- SO₂ (acid rain)

### Energy from Chemical Reactions

**5-Step Method:**
1. Identify bonds broken in reactants
2. Calculate energy INPUT to break bonds (positive)
3. Identify bonds formed in products
4. Calculate energy RELEASED forming bonds (negative)
5. Sum = net energy change

**Bond Enthalpies:**

| Bond | Enthalpy (kJ mol⁻¹) |
|------|---------------------|
| C-C | 348 |
| C-H | 414 |
| O=O | 498 |
| C=O | 805 |
| O-H | 470 |

### Nuclear Fission

**E = mc²**

- Mass difference → energy release
- Nuclear forces ~100× stronger than electromagnetic forces
- Fission of one ²³⁵U releases ~3 million times more energy than burning one octane molecule

### Energy Return on Investment (EROI)

**EROI = Energy output / Energy cost to extract**

| Source | EROI |
|--------|------|
| Hydroelectric | ~50 |
| Wind | ~18 |
| Nuclear | 5-15 |
| UK Coal | ~7 (for electricity) |
| Solar | ~7 |

EROI = 1 means resource is no longer useful (break even)

### Renewable Energy

All ultimately powered by the Sun:
- **Hydroelectric**: Gravitational PE of water (E_p = mgh)
- **Wind**: Air movement from uneven heating
- **Solar**: Direct conversion via photovoltaic cells

## Key Equations

| Equation | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Efficiency = W/E_sup | Work output ÷ Energy supplied |
| E = mc² | Mass-energy equivalence |
| EROI = E_out/E_cost | Energy return on investment |

## Important Units

- **Mole (mol)**: 6.022 × 10²³ particles
- **Atomic mass unit (u)**: 1.66 × 10⁻²⁷ kg
- **toe**: Tonne of oil equivalent = 41.9 GJ
