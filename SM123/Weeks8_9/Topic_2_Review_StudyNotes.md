# Topic 2 Review: An Introduction to Energy

## Summary - Three Main Ideas

1. **Energy is an accounting system** - conserved quantity; when energy of one thing changes, energy of other things must change to keep total constant

2. **Fundamental energy types** - At the most basic level:
   - **Kinetic energy**: associated with motion
   - **Potential energy**: associated with forces acting on parts of the system

3. **Energy transfer mechanisms**:
   - **Work**: energy transfer due to a force acting
   - **Heat**: energy transfer due to temperature difference
   - Temperature relates to microscopic motion of atoms and molecules

## Key Equations to Remember

| Equation | Name |
|----------|------|
| E_k = ½mv² | Kinetic energy |
| E_g = mgh | Gravitational potential energy (Earth surface) |
| E_g = -GMm/r | Gravitational potential energy (orbiting bodies) |
| E_el = VQ | Electrical potential energy |
| W = Fl | Work (force × distance) |
| W = PΔV | Work on a gas |
| T(K) = T(°C) + 273 | Temperature conversion |

## Key Definitions

- **Kinetic energy**: Energy associated with motion
- **Potential energy**: Energy associated with forces and position/arrangement
- **Work**: Energy transfer when a force moves something
- **Heat**: Energy transfer due to temperature difference
- **Temperature**: Measure of average kinetic energy of particles
- **Absolute zero**: 0 K (-273.15°C) - temperature at which particle motion ceases
