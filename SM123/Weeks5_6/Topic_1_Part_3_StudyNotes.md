# Topic 1 Part 3: Electromagnetic Forces and the Everyday World

## Summary

This part explores electromagnetic forces - the fundamental forces responsible for almost all everyday phenomena except gravity. Using lightning as a dramatic example, we learn about electric charges, Coulomb's law, electric fields, and magnetic fields. Remarkably, friction, spring forces, tension, normal reaction, lift, and drag are all electromagnetic in origin at the atomic level.

**Key topics covered:**
- **Electric Charge**: The property of matter that causes electrical phenomena (positive and negative)
- **Coulomb's Law**: Mathematical description of the force between charged particles
- **Electric Fields**: A way to calculate forces on charges without knowing the exact charge distribution
- **Magnetic Fields**: Fields produced by moving charges and magnets
- **Electromagnetism**: The unified theory combining electric and magnetic phenomena

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| F_el = k_e(Q₁Q₂)/r² | Coulomb's Law | Electric force between two charges |
| F_el = Qε | Electric Force from Field | Force on charge Q in electric field ε |
| ε = F_el/Q | Electric Field Strength | Field strength equals force per unit charge |

**Constants:**
- k_e = 8.99 × 10⁹ N m² C⁻²
- Electron charge = −1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
- Proton charge = +1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C

## Key Concepts

- **Electric Charge**: Property of matter causing electrical phenomena; measured in coulombs (C)
  - Two types: positive and negative
  - Like charges repel; opposite charges attract
  - Objects with equal positive and negative charge are electrically neutral

- **Coulomb's Law**: Force is proportional to product of charges, inversely proportional to square of separation
  - Positive force value = repulsion
  - Negative force value = attraction
  - If one charge is tripled, force triples
  - If distance is doubled, force reduces to 1/4

- **Electric Field**: The force per unit charge at a point in space
  - Units: N C⁻¹
  - Allows calculation of forces without knowing exact charge distribution
  - Field lines point outward from positive charges, inward toward negative charges
  - Lines closer together = stronger field

- **Uniform Electric Field**: Parallel field lines indicating constant force over a region (e.g., between charged plates)

- **Magnetic Fields**:
  - Produced by moving charges and magnets
  - Moving charges experience forces in magnetic fields
  - Force depends on: field strength, charge speed, and charge magnitude
  - Earth's magnetic field protects us from solar wind

- **Electromagnetism**: The unified theory of electric and magnetic phenomena (Maxwell's equations)
  - Almost all everyday forces except gravity are electromagnetic in origin
  - Spring forces, tension, friction, normal reaction, lift, drag - all electromagnetic at atomic level

- **Lightning**: Initiated when electrons are ripped from atoms
  - Requires force ~8.24 × 10⁻⁸ N to remove electron from hydrogen atom
  - Electric fields in clouds (~10⁴ to 10⁵ N C⁻¹) too weak to directly ionize atoms
  - Mystery: what initiates lightning? (possibly cosmic rays)

### Problem 3.2: Coulomb's Law Sign Convention

Complete the statements about force direction:
- If two charges have the same sign, then Q₁ × Q₂ is ___, so the force is ___ and indicates ___
- If Q₁ and Q₂ have opposite signs, then the product is ___ and the force is ___

**Solution:**
- If two charges have the same sign, then Q₁ × Q₂ is **positive**, so the force is **positive** and indicates **repulsion**
- If Q₁ and Q₂ have opposite signs, then the product is **negative** and the force is **negative** (indicating attraction)

### Problem 3.3: Force Between Proton and Electron

Calculate the electric force between the proton and electron in a hydrogen atom.

**Given:**
- Average distance r = 5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m
- Electron charge Q₁ = −1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
- Proton charge Q₂ = +1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
- k_e = 8.99 × 10⁹ N m² C⁻²

Options:
- (a) −8.24 × 10⁻⁸ N
- (b) −8.24 × 10⁻¹⁸ N
- (c) −8.24 × 10² N
- (d) −8.24 × 10¹² N

**Solution:**
Using Coulomb's Law: F = k_e × Q₁ × Q₂ / r²

F = (8.99 × 10⁹) × (−1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹) × (1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹) / (5.29 × 10⁻¹¹)²

F = (8.99 × 10⁹) × (−2.566 × 10⁻³⁸) / (2.798 × 10⁻²¹)

F = −2.307 × 10⁻²⁸ / 2.798 × 10⁻²¹

F = **−8.24 × 10⁻⁸ N** (Answer: a)

The negative sign indicates attraction between opposite charges.

### Problem 3.4: Units of Electric Field

Determine the SI units of electric field strength.

Options:
- (a) C N⁻¹
- (b) N
- (c) C
- (d) N C⁻¹

**Solution:**
From ε = F/Q, units are N/C = **N C⁻¹** (Answer: d)

### Problem 3.5: Force on Electron in Electric Field

Calculate the force on an electron (Q = −1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) in an electric field of ε = 1.00 × 10⁵ N C⁻¹.

Options:
- (a) −1.60 × 10⁻¹⁴ N
- (b) −1.00 × 10⁵ N
- (c) −1.60 × 10⁻²⁴ N
- (d) −1.60 × 10⁻¹⁹ N

**Solution:**
F = Qε = (−1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C) × (1.00 × 10⁵ N C⁻¹)

F = **−1.60 × 10⁻¹⁴ N** (Answer: a)

---

### Problem 3.6: Comparison of Forces

Compare the force needed to ionize an atom with the force from cloud electric fields.

**Solution:**
- Force to remove electron from atom: ~8.24 × 10⁻⁸ N
- Force from electric field in cloud: ~1.60 × 10⁻¹⁴ N

Ratio = (8.24 × 10⁻⁸) / (1.60 × 10⁻¹⁴) ≈ **5 million times larger**

This is why it's a mystery what initiates lightning - the electric fields aren't strong enough to directly ionize atoms!

## Key Facts to Remember

1. **The coulomb (C)** is a large unit - a rubbed balloon has only about 10⁻⁸ C of charge

2. **Scale of electric forces**: Two 1 C charges separated by 1 m exert ~10¹⁰ N force (about 10,000× a plane engine)

3. **Electric fields in lightning storms**: 10,000 - 100,000 N C⁻¹

4. **Ionization paradox**: Cloud electric fields are about 5 million times too weak to directly ionize atoms - what initiates lightning remains a mystery (possibly cosmic rays)

5. **Earth's magnetic field**: Protects life by deflecting the solar wind and producing the aurora borealis

6. **Electromagnetic origin**: Almost ALL everyday forces (except weight/gravity) are electromagnetic:
   - Friction
   - Spring forces
   - Tension
   - Normal reaction
   - Lift
   - Air resistance
