# Topic 9 Part 4: The Future of the Universe

## Summary

This final part addresses the ultimate fate of the Universe. It discusses the geometry of space (Open, Flat, Closed) determined by the **Critical Density**. It reviews the evidence for **Dark Matter** (galaxy rotation) and introduces **Dark Energy**, the mysterious force driving the **accelerated expansion** of the Universe today. The interplay between these components determines whether the Universe will expand forever or recollapse.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| $\rho_{crit} \approx 10^{-26} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$ | Critical Density | Density required for a "Flat" Universe. |
| $\Omega = \rho / \rho_{crit}$ | Density Parameter | Ratio of actual density to critical density. |
| $\Omega_{total} = \Omega_m + \Omega_\Lambda \approx 1$ | Cosmic Sum Rule | Total density parameter (Matter + Dark Energy) is observed to be 1 (Flat). |

## Key Concepts

-   **Geometry of Space:**
    -   **Flat ($\Omega = 1$):** Geometry is Euclidean (triangles = 180°). Expands forever but slows down.
    -   **Spherical/Closed ($\Omega > 1$):** Positive curvature (triangles > 180°). Expands then recollapses (Big Crunch).
    -   **Hyperbolic/Open ($\Omega < 1$):** Negative curvature (triangles < 180°). Expands forever rapidly.
    -   **Observation:** The Universe is spatially **Flat** ($\Omega \approx 1$).

-   **Dark Matter:**
    -   Needed to explain galaxy rotation curves and cluster dynamics.
    -   $\Omega_m \approx 0.3$ (Matter is ~30% of critical density).
    -   Since $\Omega_{total} = 1$, something else must make up the remaining 70%.

-   **Dark Energy:**
    -   Discovered in 1998 using Type Ia Supernovae (standard candles).
    -   Distant supernovae were fainter than expected, implying they were further away $\to$ Expansion is **accelerating**.
    -   **Dark Energy ($\Lambda$):** Acts as a repulsive force (anti-gravity) stretching space.
    -   $\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7$ (Dark Energy is ~70% of the Universe).

-   **Fate of the Universe:**
    -   Because of Dark Energy, the expansion will likely continue accelerating forever.
    -   **Big Freeze / Heat Death:** Galaxies recede from view, stars burn out, Universe becomes cold and dark.

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Critical Density
**Problem:** If the Universe contains only protons ($m_p \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-27}$ kg), how many per cubic meter are needed for critical density ($\rho_{crit} \approx 10^{-26} \text{ kg m}^{-3}$)?
**Solution:**
Number density $n = \rho / m_p = 10^{-26} / (1.7 \times 10^{-27}) \approx 6$ protons per $m^3$.
This shows how incredibly empty the Universe is on average.

### Activity: Composition of the Universe
-   **Ordinary Matter (Baryons):** ~5% (Stars, gas, us).
-   **Dark Matter:** ~27% (Holds galaxies together).
-   **Dark Energy:** ~68% (Pushes universe apart).

## Conclusion
The Universe started with a Hot Big Bang, evolved through inflation and nucleosynthesis, formed structure via Dark Matter, and is now dominated by Dark Energy, leading to an eternal, accelerating expansion.
