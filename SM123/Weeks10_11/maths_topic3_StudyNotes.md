## Solutions

### Solution to Activity 1

(a) SI unit of density = kg/m³ = kg m⁻³

(b)(i) From ρ = M/V, multiply both sides by V:
M = ρV
Units: kg = (kg m⁻³)(m³) = kg ✓

(b)(ii) From M = ρV, divide both sides by ρ:
V = M/ρ
Units: m³ = kg/(kg m⁻³) = m³ ✓

### Solution to Activity 2

(a) V = 0.100 × 0.250 × 0.333 = 8.325×10⁻³ m³
M = ρV = (2.60×10³)(8.325×10⁻³) = **21.6 kg**

(b) V = M/ρ = 3.00/(8.96×10³) = 3.348×10⁻⁴ m³ = **335 cm³**
Side length = V^(1/3) = **6.94 cm**

(c) ρ_Al = 2.60×10³ kg m⁻³ = **2.60 g cm⁻³**

(d) ρ_Cu = 8.96×10³ kg m⁻³ = **8.96 mg mm⁻³**

(e) Volume per atom = (0.255×10⁻⁹)³ = 1.658×10⁻²⁹ m³
Atoms per m³ = 1/(1.658×10⁻²⁹) = 6.031×10²⁸
Mass per atom = (2.60×10³)/(6.031×10²⁸) = **4.31×10⁻²⁶ kg**

(f) Mass of 1 m³ Cu = 8.96×10³ kg
Number of atoms = (8.96×10³)/(1.06×10⁻²⁵) = 8.453×10²⁸
Volume per atom = 1/(8.453×10²⁸) = 1.183×10⁻²⁹ m³
Distance = (1.183×10⁻²⁹)^(1/3) = **0.228 nm**

### Solution to Activity 3

(a) A = π(d/2)² = π(0.075×10⁻³)² = 1.767×10⁻⁸ m²
G = σA/l = (3.50×10⁷)(1.767×10⁻⁸)/(0.250) = **2.47 S**

(b) d = 2√(Gl/σπ) = 2√(0.333×2.50)/(π×5.98×10⁷) = 1.33×10⁻⁴ m = **133 µm**

(c) σ_Al = 3.50×10⁷ S m⁻¹ = **0.350 MS cm⁻¹**

(d) σ_Cu = 5.98×10⁷ S m⁻¹ = **5.98×10¹⁰ µS mm⁻¹**

### Solution to Activity 4

(a) G × R = (σA/l)(ρl/A) = σρ = (1/ρ)ρ = 1
Therefore: **G = 1/R**

(b) **1 S = 1 Ω⁻¹** (siemens is inverse of ohm)

(c) ρ_Al = 1/σ_Al = 1/(3.50×10⁷) = 2.86×10⁻⁸ Ω m = **2.86 µΩ cm**

(d) ρ_Cu = 1/σ_Cu = 1/(5.98×10⁷) = 1.67×10⁻⁸ Ω m = **1.67×10⁻¹⁷ MΩ km**
