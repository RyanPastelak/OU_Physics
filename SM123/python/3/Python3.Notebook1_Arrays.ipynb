    "## 1.1   Defining an array\n",
    "\n",
    "An **array** is an object in Python that is, or contains, an ordered set of values, exactly like a list. There are two fundamental differences, however:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will remember from Python 2 Notebook 1, Section 1.3  that it is possible to append **elements** to a list. This means that you can change the length of the list (the number of elements it contains). However, the length of an array is fixed: once it’s been created you can neither add elements to nor remove elements from it (but you can, as you will learn later, modify the values they contain, that is change its elements).\n",
    "2. You also learnt in Python 2 Notebook 1, Section 1.5 that a list can contain elements of different types: a single list can contain a string, integer numbers and real numbers. However, *all elements of an array must be of the same type*. So you can, for example, have an array of strings, or an array of integer numbers, but not an array containing both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these two limitations, you may wonder what are the advantages of arrays over llists. As you will see later, the useful feature of arrays is that you can apply arithmetic operations to all the elements of an array simultaneously, in a single command.\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is an object that is part of the `numpy` package (introduced in Python 2 Notebook 3, Section 3.1). So before defining an array, you need to import it. One way to do this would be to just import the object by including  <code>from numpy import array</code> at the start of the program. It is more usual to import the whole `numpy` package,  giving it a short name that is then used when calling the object. This name is then used. The example below shows one possible way of generating an array."

I have done this by using a list <code>[1,7,4,3]</code> (remember that the square brackets define a list) and I have then specified `int`so that my array is made of integer numbers. This specification is not essential: you can remove it (but you then need to remove the comma that precedes it) and the code will still run and print the same values (check it!). However, if you wanted the numbers to be treated as real numbers, then it would have been essential to use `float` because the numbers in the list are integers. Note that, this time, there are no spaces between the elements and the commas in the list, unlike most of the examples you’ve seen in previous weeks. This spacing does not affect how the program works, so it’s up to you to include spaces or not."

His third law of planetary motion, published in 1619, states that the square of the orbital period $P$ of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis $a$  of its elliptical orbit. Today we use the equation introduced in Topic 7 which relates $P^2$ and $a^3$ to $M$  the mass of the star which the planet is orbiting via a constant $k$ – itself a function of the gravitational constant $G$:\n",

    "\n",
    "The arrays you have been operating with so far are one-dimensional. But you can also create two-dimensional arrays (or arrays of even higher dimensions). When these arrays contain numbers, they can be thought of as matrices like those you would have considered if you studied Unit 9 of MST124. However, the properties of operations with arrays in Python are *not* the same as those of matrices. For example, the order in which matrices are multiplied is important, such that $\\mathbf{A \\times B} \\neq \\mathbf{B \\times A}$. This is not the case for arrays. The following example demonstrates some of the ways of using arrays in Python."
