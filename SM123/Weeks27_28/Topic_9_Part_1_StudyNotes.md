# Topic 9 Part 1: The Expanding Universe

## Summary

This part establishes the observational basis for the expanding universe. It explains how astronomers measure cosmic distances using **standard candles** (objects of known luminosity) and recession speeds using **redshift** (Doppler effect). These measurements lead to the **Hubble Relationship**, which implies that space itself is expanding and allows us to estimate the age of the Universe.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| $1 \text{ pc} \approx 3.26 \text{ ly} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}$ | Parsec | Standard unit of galactic distance. |
| $F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$ | Inverse Square Law | Relates Flux ($F$), Luminosity ($L$), and distance ($d$). |
| $z = \frac{\lambda_{obs} - \lambda_{emit}}{\lambda_{emit}}$ | Redshift | Fractional change in wavelength due to motion. |
| $v \approx cz$ | Recession Speed | Speed of galaxy ($v$) related to redshift ($z$) for $v \ll c$. |
| $v = H_0 d$ | Hubble's Law | Recession speed ($v$) is proportional to distance ($d$). |
| $t \approx \frac{1}{H_0}$ | Age of Universe | Hubble Time, assuming constant expansion rate. |

## Key Concepts

-   **Distance Measurement:**
    -   **Standard Candle:** An object whose true luminosity ($L$) is known (e.g., the 10th brightest galaxy in a cluster).
    -   By measuring its apparent brightness (Flux, $F$), distance can be calculated: $d = \sqrt{L / 4\pi F}$.

-   **Doppler Effect & Redshift:**
    -   Light from receding objects is shifted to longer (redder) wavelengths.
    -   **Redshift ($z$):** Observed in all distant galaxies.
    -   **Interpretation:** Not motion *through* space, but the expansion *of* space stretching the light waves.

-   **Hubble's Law:**
    -   Discovered by Edwin Hubble (1929).
    -   Plotting Speed ($v$) vs. Distance ($d$) gives a straight line.
    -   **Hubble Constant ($H_0$):** The gradient of the line. Current value $\approx 70 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$.
    -   **Implication:** The Universe is expanding uniformly. There is no center; every observer sees the same expansion.

-   **Age of the Universe:**
    -   If expansion has been constant, the time since everything was together is $1/H_0$.
    -   With $H_0 \approx 70 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$, Age $\approx 14$ billion years.

## Problems and Solutions

### Question: Inverse Square Law
**Problem:** Galaxy A is 36 times brighter than Galaxy B. Both have same luminosity. If A is at 100 Mpc, where is B?
**Solution:**
Brightness ratio $F_A / F_B = (d_B / d_A)^2 = 36$.
$d_B / d_A = \sqrt{36} = 6$.
$d_B = 6 \times d_A = 600$ Mpc.

### Activity 1.2: Virtual Telescope
**Aim:** Determine $H_0$ from data.
**Method:**
1.  Measure spectrum shift $\to$ Calculate $z$ $\to$ Calculate $v = cz$.
2.  Measure brightness $\to$ Calculate $d$ (assuming standard candle $L$).
3.  Plot $v$ vs $d$. Fit line. Gradient is $H_0$.
**Result:** $H_0 \approx 70 \text{ km s}^{-1} \text{ Mpc}^{-1}$.

### Question: Expansion of Space (Elastic Band Model)
**Scenario:** Elastic band with buttons A, B, C, D. B and C recede at 1 Mpc/Gyr. A and D (3x further apart) recede at 3 Mpc/Gyr.
**Conclusion:** Expansion rate ($H$) is constant everywhere, but apparent speed increases with distance.
**Hubble Constant:** $v/d = 1/10 = 0.1 \text{ Gyr}^{-1}$.
