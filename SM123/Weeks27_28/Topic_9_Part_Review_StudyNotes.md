# Topic 9 Review: The Big Picture

## Summary

This review consolidates the journey through cosmology. It recaps the "Hot Big Bang" model, supported by the pillars of **Expansion** (Hubble), **Background Radiation** (CMB), and **Element Abundance** (BBN). It reminds us that while we have a successful "Standard Model" of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM), huge mysteries remain: we don't know what **Dark Matter** or **Dark Energy** actually *are*, nor do we have a quantum theory of gravity to describe the Planck Era.

## The Standard Model of Cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM)
-   **$\Lambda$ (Lambda):** Dark Energy (Cosmological Constant) - ~70%
-   **CDM:** Cold Dark Matter - ~25%
-   **Baryons:** Ordinary Matter - ~5%

## Key Timeline Recapped
1.  **Big Bang:** $t=0$.
2.  **Inflation:** $10^{-35}$ s. Exponential expansion.
3.  **Nucleosynthesis:** 3 mins. H, He, Li formed.
4.  **Recombination:** 380,000 yrs. Atoms form, Universe becomes transparent (CMB).
5.  **Structure Formation:** Stars and galaxies accrete.
6.  **Today:** 13.8 billion yrs. Accelerated expansion.

## Reflection
We have moved from measuring the size of the Earth (Eratosthenes) to measuring the size and age of the entire Universe. Physics provides the tools (Doppler, Black-body, Gravity) to understand events billions of years ago and billions of light-years away.
