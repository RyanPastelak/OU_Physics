# Topic 3 Part 1: Materials Around Us

## Summary

All matter is made of atoms. Different atoms have different properties, which are classified as **physical properties** (melting temperature, conductivity, color, hardness) and **chemical properties** (reactivity, acidity, stability, toxicity). The Periodic Table organizes elements to predict their chemical behavior.

## Key Concepts

### Atomic Structure
- **Nucleus**: Contains protons (positive) and neutrons (neutral)
- **Electron shells**: Electrons (negative) orbit the nucleus
- **Atomic number**: Number of protons (defines the element)
- **Mass number**: Protons + neutrons
- **Neutral atom**: Electrons = Protons

### Electron Shells
- 1st shell: Maximum 2 electrons
- 2nd shell: Maximum 8 electrons
- 3rd shell: Maximum 18 electrons

### Electron Configuration
- Written as: Na 2, 8, 1 (sodium has 11 electrons: 2 in first shell, 8 in second, 1 in third)
- Elements in the same GROUP have the same number of outer electrons
- Same number of outer electrons → similar chemical properties

### Periodic Table Organization
- **Groups**: Vertical columns (similar properties)
- **Periods**: Horizontal rows
- **Metals**: Left side
- **Non-metals**: Right side
- **Group 1**: 1 outer electron
- **Group 17**: 7 outer electrons
- **Group 18**: Noble gases (full outer shells)

### Atomic Orbitals (Advanced)
- **1s orbital**: First shell (2 electrons max)
- **2s orbital**: Second shell, lower energy
- **2p orbitals**: Three orbitals at same energy (6 electrons total)
- Electrons fill lowest energy orbitals first
- Each orbital holds maximum 2 electrons

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1.1: Car Body Material

What is the body of the car made from?

**Solution:** The body of the car is made from **steel** (a metal alloy of iron and carbon). Steel is used because it is:
- Strong enough to protect passengers
- Malleable (can be shaped)
- Relatively inexpensive
- Can be welded together

### Problem 1.2: Particles in Potassium

Look at the symbol for potassium (K, atomic number 19, atomic mass 39). How many protons, neutrons and electrons are there?

**Solution:**
- **Protons**: 19 (equals atomic number)
- **Electrons**: 19 (equals protons in neutral atom)
- **Neutrons**: 39 - 19 = **20** (mass number minus atomic number)

---

### Problem 1.3: Identifying Element from Atomic Number

If the only information you had was that the atomic number was 19, would you still know which element it was?

**Solution:** **Yes** - the atomic number uniquely identifies an element. Atomic number 19 is always potassium (K). The atomic number tells you the number of protons, which defines what element it is.

### Problem 1.4: Atom in Figure 1.5

Look at the atom diagram. How many of each particle does the atom have? Which element is it?

**Solution:**
- **Protons**: 6 (in nucleus)
- **Neutrons**: 6 (in nucleus)
- **Electrons**: 6 (2 in first shell, 4 in second shell)
- **Element**: Carbon (C) - because it has 6 protons

### Problem 1.5: Electron Arrangement in Figure 1.5

How are the electrons arranged?

**Solution:** The electrons are arranged as **2, 4**:
- First shell: 2 electrons (full)
- Second shell: 4 electrons

---

### Problem 1.6: Electron Configurations

Write the electron configuration of lithium (atomic number 3) and silicon (atomic number 14).

**Solution:**
- **Lithium (Li)**: 2, 1 (2 in first shell, 1 in second)
- **Silicon (Si)**: 2, 8, 4 (2 in first shell, 8 in second shell, 4 in third)

---

### Problem 1.7: Drawing Boron Atom

The electron configuration of boron is B 2, 3, and the relative atomic mass is 11. Draw a representation.

**Solution:**
- **Nucleus**: 5 protons + 6 neutrons (11 - 5 = 6)
- **First shell**: 2 electrons
- **Second shell**: 3 electrons
- Total electrons = 5 (equals protons for neutral atom)

---

### Problem 1.8: Nitrogen Atom Drawing

Draw an electron shell diagram for nitrogen (atomic number 7, atomic mass 14).

**Solution:**
- **Nucleus**: 7 protons + 7 neutrons
- **First shell**: 2 electrons
- **Second shell**: 5 electrons
- Electron configuration: **2, 5**

---

### Problem 1.9: Group 17 Electron Configurations

Write the electron configurations for F, Cl, and Br.

**Solution:**
- **Fluorine (F)**: Atomic number 9 → **2, 7**
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: Atomic number 17 → **2, 8, 7**
- **Bromine (Br)**: Atomic number 35 → **2, 8, 18, 7**

---

### Problem 1.10: Pattern in Group 17

What do you notice about these electron configurations?

**Solution:** All Group 17 elements have **7 electrons in their outer shell**. This is why they have similar chemical properties - they all need to gain 1 electron to achieve a noble gas configuration.

---

### Problem 1.11: Similar Properties to Sodium

Which elements will have similar chemical properties to Na?

**Solution:** Elements in **Group 1** (the alkali metals): Li, K, Rb, Cs, Fr

All have 1 outer electron and similar chemical properties - they are all reactive metals that form +1 ions.

### Activity 1.3 Answers: Summarising Atomic Structure

- Atoms are made up of a nucleus surrounded by **electrons**
- The atomic number is the number of **protons** in the nucleus
- The mass number is the sum of protons plus **neutrons**
- The number of **protons** tells us what element the atom is
- Protons are **positively charged**
- Neutrons are **neutral (no charge)**
- Electrons are **negatively charged**
