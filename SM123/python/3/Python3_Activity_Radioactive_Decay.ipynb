    "Write a program using Python that does the following:\n",
    "1. Prompts the user to input the name of a particular isotope and its half-life, $\\tau$, in seconds. \n",
    "2. Prompts the user for an initial amount of the isotope (in grams) and an elapsed time (in seconds). \n",
    "3. Calculates the amount of the isotope remaining after this elapsed time and displays the result.\n",
    "4. Calculates the initial mass of the isotope (in grams) necessary to ensure that, after half a minute, 5 grams of it remain, and displays the result.\n",
    "5. Plots the amount of the isotope remaining as a function of time, from elapsed time $t = 0$ s until $t = 10$ s.  \n",
    "6. The program should then repeat the instructions from step 1, until the user chooses to halt the program. \n",
    "7. When the user wishes to enter no more isotopes, the program should display the decay plots for all of the isotopes that were entered, in a single plot, and print out a list of all the isotopes studied.\n",

    "* You will probably want to import functions from the `numpy`, `math` and `matplotlib` packages.\n",
    "* You will probably want to make use of Equations 2.1a and 2.1c from Topic 6, Section 2.5. You may also want to revise the exercises that appear after those equations.\n",
