# Topic 7 Part 1: Observing the Universe

## Summary

This part introduces the methods used by astronomers to observe the Universe. It covers the scales of the Universe, from the Solar System to distant galaxies, and the units used to measure them (AU and light-years). It explains the concepts of angular size and angular resolution, which are crucial for interpreting observations. The section also discusses the role of telescopes, both ground-based and space-based, and the different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum used for observation. Finally, it touches on cutting-edge techniques like gravitational wave and neutrino astronomy.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Name | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| $1 \text{ AU} \approx 1.50 \times 10^8 \text{ km}$ | Astronomical Unit | Average Earth-Sun distance, used for Solar System scales. |
| $c \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m s}^{-1}$ | Speed of Light | Speed of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum. |
| $1 \text{ ly} \approx 9.46 \times 10^{12} \text{ km}$ | Light-year | Distance light travels in one year, used for stellar/galactic scales. |
| $\theta = \frac{\text{actual size}}{\text{distance}}$ | Angular Size (radians) | Relates angular size ($\theta$) to actual size and distance (small angle approx). |
| $\theta^\circ \approx 57.3 \times \frac{\text{actual size}}{\text{distance}}$ | Angular Size (degrees) | Practical version of the angular size equation for degrees. |

## Key Concepts

-   **Astronomical Unit (AU):** A convenient unit for distances within the Solar System (approx. 150 million km).
-   **Light-year (ly):** The distance light travels in a year, used for distances to stars and galaxies.
-   **Angular Size:** The angle an object subtends at the observer's eye. It depends on both the object's actual size and its distance.
    -   *Solar Eclipse Coincidence:* The Sun is ~400x larger than the Moon but ~400x further away, so they have the same angular size (~0.5°).
-   **Angular Resolution:** The smallest angular separation at which two distinct objects can be distinguished. The human eye's resolution is ~0.01°.
-   **Atmospheric Absorption:** The Earth's atmosphere absorbs most electromagnetic radiation (X-rays, UV, most IR). Only **visible light** and **radio waves** penetrate freely to the ground. This is a primary reason for space telescopes.
-   **Light Pollution & Twinkling:** Ground-based observing is hindered by artificial light and atmospheric turbulence ("twinkling").
-   **New Astronomies:**
    -   **Gravitational Waves:** Ripples in spacetime caused by massive acceleration (e.g., black hole mergers). Detected by LIGO.
    -   **Neutrinos:** Weakly interacting particles from nuclear reactions (Sun, supernovae).

## Problems and Solutions

### Question 1: Angular Size Calculation
**Problem:** Using the angular size equation, calculate the angular size in degrees if an object has actual size $D$ and distance $d$.
**Solution:**
Using $\theta^\circ \approx 57.3 \times \frac{D}{d}$.
-   If $D$ increases (object gets bigger) $\to$ Angular size increases.
-   If $d$ increases (object gets further) $\to$ Angular size decreases.

### Activity 1.3: Distance to the Moon
**Problem:** Calculate the distance to the Moon using a coin to eclipse it.
**Given:** Coin diameter ($d_{coin}$), Distance to eye ($L$), Moon diameter ($D_{moon} = 3474 \text{ km}$).
**Method:**
1.  Measure angular size of coin: $\theta \approx 57.3 \times \frac{d_{coin}}{L}$.
2.  Since coin just covers Moon, $\theta_{moon} = \theta_{coin}$.
3.  Rearrange for Moon distance: $\text{Distance} = 57.3 \times \frac{D_{moon}}{\theta}$.
**Typical Result:** Angular size $\approx 0.5^\circ$. Distance $\approx 384,000 \text{ km}$.

## Activities

### Activity 1.1: Scale of the Universe
**Aim:** To appreciate the vast range of scales in astronomy.
**Key Scales:**
-   **Solar System:** ~40-50 AU radius.
-   **Nearest Star:** ~4.2 light-years.
-   **Milky Way Galaxy:** ~100,000 light-years diameter.
-   **Observable Universe:** Billions of light-years.

### Activity 1.2: Naked-eye Observation
**Aim:** To identify objects visible without a telescope.
**Visible Objects:**
-   **Sun/Moon:** Obvious discs.
-   **Planets:** Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (look like bright stars that don't twinkle).
-   **Stars:** Pinpoints of light.
-   **Milky Way:** Hazy band (if dark enough).
-   **Andromeda Galaxy:** Faint fuzz (very difficult).
-   **Meteors/Satellites:** Moving points of light.
